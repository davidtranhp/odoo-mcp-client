"""Behavioral gates for the odoo-instance subsystem hardening (v4.9.0).

Three coherent contracts are locked in by these read-only prose assertions:

  ITEM 4 - active-wait on long builds. A long -i/-u/--test-enable build can exceed
           the foreground Bash tool timeout; the odoo-instance-ops agent MUST launch
           it in the background and poll LOG_PATH to a TERMINAL marker (never
           idle-stall). The skill relays a short form of the same contract.

  ITEM 2 - subagent self-provision via Skill(odoo-instance). A dispatched leaf that
           lacks an INSTANCE_HANDLE self-provisions by invoking Skill(odoo-instance)
           (which carries the HARD RULES), NEVER by a bare allocator.py call - the
           bypass that would skip those rules. (The depth-cap-motivated "never
           launch odoo-instance-ops directly" coercion was removed in a later wave -
           whichever path the caller's context uses to provision, the HARD RULES
           apply either way.) HARD RULES stay single-sourced in the agent
           (cross-referenced, not duplicated).

  ITEM 5 (gap fix) - the odoo-coder / odoo-frontend-coder CODER agents were missed by
           ITEM 2: their own no-handle self-provisioning fallback (the backend lint
           gate's isolated instance, the frontend quick-smoke server) still called
           `scripts/lib/allocator.py acquire` directly, bypassing the same HARD RULES
           the coders' own lint/smoke gate depends on (crucially the lint-module
           install union). Fixed to route through Skill(odoo-instance), like every
           other self-provisioning leaf.

Prose is line-wrapped in the source, so every phrase assertion runs against a
whitespace-normalized copy of the file.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# LIVE-RUN DEFECT 1 - the agent idle-stalled instead of driving the blocking
# mechanism that already existed.
#
# Observed twice in one run: odoo-instance-ops launched a build with
# `run_in_background: true`, then ENDED ITS TURN on a text-only "waiting for
# the background test run to complete" reply while odoo-bin had already exited
# and the log already held its terminal marker. A third case lost the launching
# shell (reaped before it printed its own STATUS=/TEST_RESULT= line) while the
# orphaned odoo-bin ran to completion.
#
# The mechanism was never missing: `55-instance-ops.sh wait-log` genuinely
# BLOCKS in one foreground Bash call and returns BUILD_RESULT=success|failure|
# timeout. What was missing was the INSTRUCTION SHAPE around it:
#   (a) it was named as "prefer the deterministic helper" - advisory, so an
#       agent could legally not use it;
#   (b) it was never told apart from the `run_in_background: true` pattern one
#       line above, so backgrounding the WAIT (which returns instantly with no
#       BUILD_RESULT) read as compliant;
#   (c) the harness's own generic Bash guidance ("if waiting for a background
#       task you will be notified - do not poll") was never overridden, and an
#       agent following that generic default correctly ends its turn - and
#       stalls, because no notification resumes a dispatched agent's ended turn;
#   (d) skills/odoo-instance/SKILL.md's relay dropped the mechanism NAME
#       entirely, so the two statements of one contract disagreed.
#
# The pre-fix guards above assert only that phrases EXIST. These assert the
# instruction SHAPE, over whitespace-normalized text, so a reworded regression
# still fails: a concrete invocation (not a bare mention), a mandate rather
# than a preference, a foreground requirement, an explicit override of the
# harness default, a ban on the text-only turn end, and agreement between the
# two files.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# LIVE-RUN DEFECT 2 - a per-module verdict silently covered other modules.
#
# Observed: a run-tests dispatch with GATE_ROLE: per-module-verify for one
# module ran UNSCOPED. Odoo's auto_install fan-out pulled in 63 modules and
# 1626 tests from the declared profile, including PRE-EXISTING failures in
# unrelated addon repos, and those failures decided the verdict of a run that
# was nominally verifying ONE module (whose real depends closure is two
# modules).
#
# The FIRST fix made the SCOPE part of the verdict: the figures actually
# observed, plus an explicit statement when the verdict was decided outside the
# module under verification. It also forbade the executor from adding
# --test-tags at all, on the reasoning that any narrowing suppresses tests.
#
# That second half was too broad, and produced its own defect: with tags
# forbidden by default, every run-tests dispatch ran UNTAGGED, so `-i sale`
# tested the whole installed registry from `base` up - minutes-to-hours of wall
# clock for a verdict about a tree nobody asked about.
#
# The corrected contract splits the two cases that the blanket ban conflated
# (SSOT: snippets/test-scope-contract.md):
#   SCOPING     - tags COVERING every module in --modules. The run tests exactly
#                 what the caller declared; fan-out outside --modules was never
#                 in scope, so not running it hides nothing. Required, and
#                 DERIVED from --modules when the brief carries no tags.
#   SUPPRESSION - tags narrower than --modules, or an unrequested
#                 skip-auto-install, so a module the caller DID declare stops
#                 being exercised. Still forbidden: that manufactures a false
#                 green.
# These guards protect both halves, so neither the untagged-by-default defect
# nor the suppression "fix" can return.
