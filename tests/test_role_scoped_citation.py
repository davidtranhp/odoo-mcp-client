"""Guard [role-scope] (rule 11 in generator/check_orchestration.py, M6 in
12-design-final.md).

A `role: leaf` agent launches nothing, so the spawner-tier contracts
(spawner-completion-contract.md, concurrency-guard.md) do not bind it -
the file itself says so (spawner-completion-contract.md's own "vacuously compliant" sentence).
Between them the 25 leaf agents used to cite ~1MB of spawner-tier contract they could never
execute; M6 deletes those citations and replaces them with a one-line pointer to
worker-brief.md/continuation-contract.md/dispatch-brief.md instead.

The rule has three halves:
  (a) a `role: leaf` agent body may not cite any member of the spawner-tier set.
  (b) a `role: spawner|coordinator` agent body MUST cite spawner-completion-contract.md - it
      launches agents, so R3 (completion-report addressing) binds it directly.
  (c) the SAME body must state, in prose the running agent can read, that it does not author the
      source it dispatches. The frontmatter `description` is the launcher's routing listing and is
      never part of the running agent's system prompt, so a prohibition kept only there is one the
      agent was never given.

Half (b)'s subject set (agents with role in {spawner, coordinator}) must never be allowed to pass
vacuously when empty - an empty subject set would otherwise produce zero findings and look
identical to "every spawner complies". This file proves BOTH halves fire for the right reason
(red-before-green, on synthetic fixtures via monkeypatch - never touching the real tree), then
separately verifies the real tree: every leaf/spawner is data-driven from the registry `role`
field (never a hardcoded agent-name list), and the citer set of every spawner-tier file equals
that registry's role=spawner|coordinator set exactly - in both directions.
