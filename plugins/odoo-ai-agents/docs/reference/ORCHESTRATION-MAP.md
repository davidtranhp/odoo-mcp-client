# Orchestration Map (GENERATED - do not edit by hand)

## Legend

- **spawn_class** - `leaf` (runs inline) · `orchestrator-nl` (chains other skills via
  natural-language dispatch; no subagent spawn of its own - see a skill's own spawns
  cell for any anonymous review/resolver subagent) · `spawner-agent` (dispatches a
  subagent).
- **handoff** - Context-Handoff Protocol (CHP) tier for resuming subagents across turns.
  `send-message` (Tier-A: a launcher resumes a child it launched, by the id its own
  launch returned, avoiding cold-spawn overhead) · `fork` (Tier-B: subagent_type=fork fan-out inheriting parent
  context + prompt cache) · `fresh` (Tier-C default: cold-spawn every turn via agent
  launch + worklog blackboard - always-correct baseline; implicit when field is absent).
- **stack** - drives backend↔frontend routing; `fullstack` work must engage both a
  backend and a frontend specialist.

## Skills that may spawn

Derived from a non-empty `spawns` entry, NOT from `spawn_class` - the same predicate `orchestration-digest.txt` uses ([NEW]-2), so the two artifacts cannot disagree. Two spawn_classes legitimately appear here: (1) a `spawner-agent` (launches a named subagent directly); (2) an `orchestrator-nl` whose `spawns` are SKILL invocations it drives transitively via the Skill tool (e.g. `run-harness` chaining `odoo-coding` / `git-ops`) - it launches no agent itself, but the skills it dispatches may, so surfacing it here is correct, not a defect. Only a `leaf` listed here is a genuine drift to fix at the SSOT (a leaf must never carry a `spawns` entry - either its class or the `spawns` entry is wrong).

`odoo-acceptance`, `odoo-brl`, `odoo-code-review`, `odoo-coding`, `odoo-debug`, `odoo-deep-survey`, `odoo-doc-feature-map`, `odoo-doc-illustration`, `odoo-doc-walkthrough`, `odoo-forward-port`, `odoo-gap-analysis`, `odoo-git-rebase`, `odoo-i18n`, `odoo-icon-design`, `odoo-instance`, `odoo-intake`, `odoo-modules-upgrade`, `odoo-planning`, `odoo-pr-monitoring`, `odoo-solution-design`, `odoo-ui-review`, `run-harness`, `workflow-chaining`

## Skill Conflict Resolution

Full skill-collision policy with worked examples lives in `skills/odoo-intake/references/collision-zones.md`. The one case below is specific to a single skill and kept here:

### `odoo-coding`: legacy JS widgets vs OWL (version-aware)

- **No skill conflict:** A single skill - `odoo-coding` - owns all Odoo coding (backend Python/XML and front-end JS/OWL) and, for the front end, handles both paradigms internally via the `odoo-frontend-coder` agent.
- **Resolution (internal):** the `odoo-frontend-coder` agent selects the paradigm, and the paradigm boundary itself is owned by `snippets/odoo-era-boundaries.md` rows 1 and 1b - resolve it there. This map states no Odoo version fact of its own.
