# Test-First Contract (red before green, behavior not snapshot)

The test protects **business behavior**, not the current implementation, and MUST exist before the
code it protects. A change that cannot go red at all is exempt ONLY under a caller-declared
`TEST_EXEMPTION` (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/test-exemption-contract.md`) - never infer an
exemption from a missing test.

## The red-before-green sequence

1. **Author the test from the business rule** - phrase it as the rule it protects, assert only
   **observable outcomes** (return value, state change, contract-level side effect), never
   internals (private method, call counts, variable names). One intent + one expected outcome per
   test. For the version-correct framework/class and OSM grounding, follow
   `skills/odoo-test-writing/SKILL.md` and `docs/reference/ODOO-TESTING.md` - this contract governs
   the discipline, that governs the shape.
2. **Prove it can go RED** - a RED is MEASURED or CONSTRUCTED, never asserted. Which proof this
   change owes (`RED_MODE`), and why a `KeyError` / missing-field / 0-selected failure is a broken
   measurement and not a red: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/red-evidence-contract.md`.
3. **Write the minimum code to go GREEN** - implement until the test passes, nothing speculative.
4. **Never edit the test to fit the code.** If a test fails after coding: fix the code if the code
   is wrong; change the test only if the test's *intent* was wrong - and say so explicitly. Banned:
   relaxing/deleting assertions, changing expected values to match actual output, `@skip`/
   comment-out to get a green pipeline.

## Authorship (who writes the red test)

Test authoring is UNIVERSAL and always independent: for EVERY module the RED test is authored by the
dedicated **`odoo-test-writer` agent** (a context-isolated executor that invokes the
`odoo-test-writing` skill inline), launched FIRST - so the author of the test is never the author of
the code. The code-author (`odoo-backend-coder` / `odoo-frontend-coder`) then implements to green and
must not touch the test. The coders never author tests; the coordinator (`odoo-coder`) launches the
`odoo-test-writer` per work-item before the coder. Callers outside the coding loop - odoo-acceptance,
odoo-code-review, odoo-forward-port, odoo-git-rebase - likewise launch the `odoo-test-writer` agent
for context isolation rather than authoring inline. (`odoo-qa-suite`'s Phase 1 is a static/inline
test-PLAN, not a runnable test file, so it is not a caller here.)

## The loop, bounded

`code -> review + test -> code`: after code goes green, review runs and the tests run. If review
finds CRITICAL/HIGH issues OR a test is red, loop back to code. Bound the loop to **3 iterations**;
if still not green-and-clean, STOP and escalate. Record each iteration's outcome in the worklog
(`worklog-contract.md`).

## Forward-port case: RED-on-target as evidence

When a test is forward-ported to a target platform and **runs RED** on that platform for the first
time (not before the code, but after landing the forward), it proves: the target platform lacks
the behavior. This is **different from red-before-green** (writing a new test that fails first).
RED-on-target signals: the feature needs platform-specific adaptation, not just syntax-translation.
GREEN-on-target immediately after code adaptation means: the target now satisfies intent. Use
RED-on-target as a **gate** - do not skip forward-porting the test or stub it to pass; let it fail
and drive the platform-adapt code.
