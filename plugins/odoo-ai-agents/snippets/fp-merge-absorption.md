# FP Merge Absorption (git merge protocol + per-batch verify)

## Git operation - ONE merge for the whole range, ONE merge commit

**The unit of the git operation is the RANGE, never the commit.** A forward-port run absorbs
every commit in `<merge-base>..<source-ref>` with a SINGLE merge of the range's TIP commit, and
closes it with a SINGLE merge commit - exactly the shape an ordinary branch-level merge has.
Every commit in the range becomes an ancestor of that merge commit, so every source SHA is
preserved and the merge-base advances to the tip in one step.

**Continuous forward-port** (recurring, source repo keeps evolving):

Invoke the **`git-toolkit:git-ops`** skill (via the Skill tool; see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/git-delegation.md`):
- `op: merge --no-ff --no-commit <src-tip-SHA>` (request worktree isolation), where `<src-tip-SHA>`
  is the LAST (newest) commit of the range this run forwards - after any `--since` filter.

On return from git-ops, the working tree is the absorption zone for the WHOLE range. All adapt
work (steps 1-4 in "Absorption window" below) happens there, driven by the per-commit intent
records, inside this one open merge window. When adapt is complete, invoke
**`git-toolkit:git-ops`** again, ONCE:
- `op: commit`, `message: "fp: absorb <src-first-SHA>..<src-tip-SHA> - <one-line summary>"`

`--no-ff` forces a true merge commit so the source history enters the DAG of the target branch.
The merge-base advances to `<src-tip-SHA>` after the commit. Next run, the scoped log
(src..tgt) will no longer see ANY commit in the range - no re-resolution ever.

### Two banned shapes (both produce the defects this protocol exists to prevent)

1. **BANNED - one merge per commit.** Never loop `merge <sha-1>` / commit / `merge <sha-2>` /
   commit over the range. It mints N merge commits for ONE logical forward-port (the target
   history reads as N unrelated integrations), and every hunk touched by more than one source
   commit is conflict-resolved once per commit instead of once per run. An ordinary branch-level
   merge never behaves this way, and neither does this pipeline.
2. **BANNED - cherry-pick per commit (any mode).** Each cherry-pick mints a FRESH SHA on the
   target: the merge-base does not move, so tomorrow's run re-encounters every commit and
   re-resolves every conflict, permanently. This is the single most expensive mistake available
   in a forward-port.

**Batching does NOT reinstate either shape.** A batch is a VERIFY-and-GATE unit, not a git unit.
If the human splits the run at the plan gate, each batch boundary is a source SHA, and batch *k*
merges the LAST SHA of batch *k* - absorbing every commit up to it in one merge. So `N` batches
produce at most `N` merge commits, never one per commit; the default (a single batch) produces
exactly ONE. A batch is never allowed to be "one commit each" as a way to reach a per-commit merge.

**One-shot mode** (port once, source is frozen, or only a sub-range may land): invoke
**`git-toolkit:git-ops`** with `op: cherry-pick -n <src-first-SHA>^..<src-tip-SHA>` - the WHOLE range in
ONE staged sequencer run (`-n` / no-commit keeps the tree open for absorption; request this
explicitly in the brief), closed by ONE commit, exactly like the merge shape above. Never one
cherry-pick call per commit. Record in `merge-log.md` that this mode does NOT preserve SHA and
does NOT advance the merge-base: the run is not repeatable, which is why one-shot is reserved for
a frozen source (or a deliberate sub-range that must not drag the rest of the branch in).

## Absorption window (inside the ONE no-commit merge)

Between the no-commit merge opened by git-ops and the subsequent commit step, the
working tree is the absorption zone **for the whole range**. There is exactly ONE such window per
run (or per batch, when the human split the run at the plan gate) - it opens once, stays open
across every module's adapt work, and closes once. All work happens here - in this order:

1. Symbol-survival check - see [[fp-symbol-survival-check]] BEFORE touching any file. It runs
   ONCE over the merged result of the whole range, not once per source commit.
2. Resolve conflict markers in source-touched files (3-way merge, platform-adapt per bucket,
   see [[fp-intent-4outcome]]). A file touched by several commits in the range is resolved ONCE,
   against the range's combined result - re-resolving it per commit is the banned shape above.
2a. **Manifest version (C1) - never invent a bump.** `--no-ff` already carries whatever the source
    commit did to the module descriptor - which filename applies on which series is owned by
    `odoo-era-boundaries.md` row 6, never restated here. Do NOT
    add, derive, or increment a `version` bump on the target side. On a module-descriptor `version`
    CONFLICT, keep the **TARGET** file's `version` field as-is - never merge-pick the higher number,
    never bump "to be safe". (The only bump permitted anywhere in forward-port is the C2 case below,
    and it is a migration-threshold bump, not a conflict decision.)
3. Forward tests - translate API to target, strip implementation-coupled assertions
   (see [[test-behavior-contract]]).
4. Fix any lint/eslint/prettier errors introduced by the merge.
5. Invoke `git-toolkit:git-ops` to commit - the merge commit encapsulates the entire
   translation cost.

Do NOT ask git-ops to commit until verify is green (P9, below). Do NOT open a second
no-commit merge while one is in progress (git index is shared; git-toolkit enforces this).

## Migration dir retarget (C2) - distinct from C1

C1 ("keep target / no manual bump") does NOT license leaving a migration dir on the source series.
A v17 commit adds `migrations/17.0.a.b.c/`. Let `S` = `a.b.c` (source). Let `M` = the target module's
manifest `version` BEFORE this forward-port (the version deployed target DBs have already reached).
A migration runs only on UPGRADE and only when `installed < dir_version <= manifest`.

Decision criterion: **does the fix need to apply to native-target-series data?**

1. **Default (yes - applies on the target series):** RETARGET the prefix to the target series and pick
   `V` so the dir fires on a deployed target DB sitting at `M`:
   - `S > M`: `V = S` (the merge already bumped the manifest M->S; just name the dir `<tgt>.S`, no extra bump).
     (Exception: if C1 fired on this commit - the merge had a `version` conflict and TARGET's value was kept,
     leaving manifest at M not S - treat as the `S <= M` case below; bump manifest to S so `dir <= manifest` holds.)
   - `S <= M`: `V` = `M`'s last component +1 (next patch); **bump the manifest to V** - keeping `a.b.c=S`
     would leave `dir <= installed` and it would NEVER run. Set **manifest version == dir version == V**.
   - Dir named FULL `<tgt-series>.V`. Invariant: the retargeted dir version MUST be `<= the final manifest version` (guarantees `M < V <= manifest`; if this would be violated, use the `S <= M` bump path).
2. **Exception (legacy source-origin-only data fix, irrelevant to native-target data):** KEEP the dir as
   `<src-series>.a.b.c`, do NOT bump. It still fires for src->tgt jumpers below `a.b.c`; it can never fire
   on a native-target DB (17 < 18), which is correct.
3. **C1 vs C2 de-confliction:** a manifest bump is FORBIDDEN for ordinary code commits and for conflict
   resolution (keep target). It is REQUIRED **only** in case 1 when `S <= M`; the bump target is the
   **current target manifest's next patch**, not `S`.
4. Dir name is always FULL `<tgt-series>.x.y.z` (Viindoo convention; FULL compare lets a target-series dir
   exceed a native-target DB's installed version). Migrations must be idempotent: a fully-updated source DB
   jumping the major re-runs a retargeted tip migration.
5. Module that is `installable:False` at target = lint-only lane - do NOT retarget its migrations.
   Rule and the clean-tip read: `[[fp-installable-false]]`.

### WHY (verified against Odoo source - module.py + migration.py, byte-identical v17/v18)

`adapt_version()` at `odoo/modules/module.py` - the series-prefixing role of `adapt_version` (the same
function also enforces the v17 version-string regex - see [[odoo-version-pivots]]) prefixes a short
manifest `a.b.c` to `<series>.a.b.c` and stores it as the module's `installed_version`.
`MigrationManager.migrate_module` (`odoo/modules/migration.py`) runs a dir only when
`installed_version < dir <= <series>.<manifest>`. So a dir left at `<src-series>.a.b.c` SILENTLY SKIPS
every DB already at the source-series state when it upgrades to the target series. Migrations run on
UPGRADE only (never fresh install).

Worked: M=0.1.2, S=0.1.2 (M==S) -> bump to 0.1.3, dir `18.0.0.1.3` (keeping 0.1.2: `18.0.0.1.2 <
18.0.0.1.2` false -> never runs). M=0.1.1, S=0.1.2 (M<S) -> dir `18.0.0.1.2`, no extra bump.
M=0.1.4, S=0.1.2 (M>S) -> S<=M applies -> bump to 0.1.5, dir `18.0.0.1.5`, manifest bumped to 0.1.5
(naming dir `18.0.0.1.2` would never run: 0.1.4 < 0.1.2 is false).
Legacy-only `17.0.a.b.c` -> kept, fires for v17 jumpers, inert on native v18 (correct).

After the rename, sweep the body for source-series literals (log strings, version constants) - they
survive the rename and mislead operators.

## Skip-code-but-still-absorb rule

Outcome buckets (a) and (d) from [[fp-intent-4outcome]] require NO adapt diff:

- **(a) already satisfied** - target platform already provides the behavior; the source
  commit adds nothing. Forward the tests only (they will pass immediately against target).
- **(d) no longer relevant** - the source commit worked around a platform limitation that
  the target has removed.

**In both cases the commit is still ABSORBED - never excluded from the merge range.** The single
range merge is what advances the merge-base past them; a bucket is a statement about ADAPT WORK,
never about git topology. Narrowing the merged range to skip an (a)/(d) commit - or splitting it
out so the range becomes non-contiguous - leaves the merge-base behind it, and tomorrow's
forward-port encounters it again. Record each (a)/(d) bucket and its reason on that commit's
`merge-log.md` row (and name them in the single merge commit's message body) so reviewers see why
those SHAs carry no diff.

## Verify protocol - per-batch, not per-commit

Running a full install + test-enable pass for every absorbed commit is prohibitive. Batch
verification instead: collect every commit in one P10 gate window into a batch, then verify the
WHOLE batch on ONE ephemeral instance. The DEFAULT batch is the whole run - one merge, one verify
pass, one gate, one merge commit; splitting into several batches is a human decision taken at the
plan gate, and each batch still merges its own range TIP once (§ Git operation above), never one
commit at a time.

**Delegate the instance - never a raw `allocator.py`/`odoo-bin` invocation.** Provisioning,
install, and test-run all go through the `odoo-instance` skill
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/odoo-instance/SKILL.md`) via the Skill tool. Only
`odoo-instance-ops` and the instance-touching HARD LEAVES enumerated in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/instance-handle-contract.md` may call `scripts/lib/allocator.py` or
`odoo-bin` directly (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/worker-brief.md` § Carve-out) - a bare
allocator/odoo-bin call from this orchestration layer bypasses the instance HARD RULES `odoo-instance`
enforces (`en_US` union, Viindoo `to_base`, lint-module install, per-version `cli_help` grounding)
and, for forward-port specifically, the `WORKTREE_PATH` re-root that keeps verification pointed at
the adapted worktree instead of the principal checkout.

1. Collect the batch (module set = every module touched by the batch's commits).
2. Dispatch `odoo-instance` ONCE for the batch: `operation: run-tests`, `persist: ephemeral`,
   `modules: <the batch's affected modules>`, `test_tags: <`/<m>` per module in that list - the
   install closure and the tag set are two sides of one scope;
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/test-scope-contract.md`>`, `mode: fresh` (install + test in one pass - Odoo
   create-on-init builds the DB; the allocator only reserves the DB name/ports, it never runs
   `createdb` directly). Memory-cap is applied automatically inside `odoo-instance-ops` - no
   separate field to pass (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/odoo-bin-resource-limits.md`). For the
   forward-port-specific `WORKTREE_PATH` re-root, see
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/odoo-forward-port/references/fp-phase-detail.md` P9 for the
   concrete dispatch brief.
3. For a re-verify after a fix inside the SAME batch, or for a SUBSEQUENT batch touching only a
   subset, re-dispatch `odoo-instance` with the SAME returned `INSTANCE_HANDLE` and `mode: reuse`
   (`-u` semantics) on the changed modules only - skip the full reinstall.
4. Release the instance when the batch is done: dispatch `odoo-instance` with `operation: drop`,
   passing the batch's `lease_token`/`run_id`. This stops any bound process first, then drops the
   DB through Odoo - never a raw `dropdb` or a bare `allocator.py release`.

Cache the returned `lease_token`/`run_id` in the batch's worklog entry (see [[worklog-contract]])
so a crash during the batch can release the DB (step 4) rather than leaving it orphaned.

## RED-then-GREEN + confirm-by-toggle

After install:

- **RED-then-GREEN (all tests):** the full suite for the target module must be green.
  A pre-existing red test is a pre-existing failure - triage it (see Triage below), do not
  fix it as part of this forward-port.
- **Confirm-by-toggle (FP-delta tests only):** for each test that was NEWLY forwarded
  in this batch, temporarily disable the corresponding adapt code (comment out the patch,
  revert the field rename, etc.) and re-run ONLY that test. It must go RED. Then restore.
  This proves the test actually exercises the adapted behavior and is not green-by-accident.
  Do NOT toggle the entire suite - it is expensive and already covered by RED-then-GREEN.

## Triage: FP-delta vs pre-existing failure

A `--test-enable` build runs a Python suite AND one or more browser (Hoot/QUnit) suites, and the
`instance-ops` block reports them in separate fields for a reason: `failed`/`errors` cover the
Python suite only, while `js_failed_reported`/`js_failed_tests` cover the browser suites. **Triage
each JS RUN separately** - a run is one browser-suite logger scope (desktop, mobile, and any module
shipping its own JS suite), the findings file lists the failing tests under the run they failed in,
and one run can be a clean pre-existing failure while another is an FP-delta. Never fold the runs
together, and never treat one run's green result as the build's: they are independent verdicts.
A `js_failed_reported` that outruns `failed` by orders of magnitude is the normal shape of a broken
browser suite, not a parsing artifact.

When a test is red after the batch install:

1. Run the same test against the target branch WITHOUT any absorption commits applied
   (a clean checkout of the target tip). If it is ALSO red there, it is a **pre-existing
   failure** - record it in the worklog, do not touch it, do not block the batch on it.
2. If it is green on the clean target but red after absorption, it is an **FP-delta
   failure** - root-cause and fix before committing the batch.

Never widen or relax an assertion to make a pre-existing failure green - that violates
[[test-behavior-contract]].

### C3 - fix old version first (provenance)

The same FP-delta / pre-existing discriminator above governs WHERE a bug is fixed - reactively at P9
(a red test) AND proactively at P8 (a coder who SPOTS a defect while adapting, before tests run):

- **Pre-existing** (also red on the clean target tip / pre-dates the port): carry it FAITHFULLY forward -
  do NOT inline-fix on the destination. Surface it to the SOURCE series so the source is fixed too and the
  fix forward-ports up naturally. The orchestrator invokes **`git-toolkit:git-ops`** to open a source-series
  issue, **conditional on a resolvable source remote** (mirror P12's `git remote get-url origin`); if none,
  record the deferred bug in `merge-log.md` and the Continuation Contract instead of opening an issue.
- **FP-delta** (green on source, red after adapt): fix it here, now (already the rule above).
- **Security/safety EXCEPTION:** fix on the destination IMMEDIATELY, then still open a source-series issue.

Canonical merge-log record: `<sha> | C3 | source issue <ref|DEFERRED> | <evidence one-liner>`.
Reviewer backstop (P12): flag any FP-delta diff that inline-fixes a pre-existing source bug (not
security/safety); an inherited bug carried faithfully + routed upstream is correct.

## Ephemeral isolation - CREATEDB required

An `ephemeral` acquire either returns an ISOLATED throwaway DB or FAILS - it never silently shares
the declared database, so two parallel batches can never collide on one DB unnoticed.
On any acquire refusal - exit 6, 7, 8 or 9, the complete set - STOP. For 6 (the role lacks
`CREATEDB`) or 7 (undeterminable): either have a human grant `CREATEDB`, or re-dispatch `--mode
exclusive` and run the remaining batches ONE AT A TIME, stating in your report that isolation was not
provided. For 8/9 (Odoo cannot authenticate / the cluster did not answer) `exclusive` is gated too -
fix the cluster first; no mode gets past them.

## Git topology - two-tier worktrees (summary)

The integration worktree branches from the TARGET branch (never the target branch directly -
no direct commits land there during forward-port). Adapt work happens DIRECTLY in that integration
worktree - the single open merge window spans the whole range, so no per-module child worktree can
ever converge back into it (full derivation: `skills/odoo-forward-port/SKILL.md` § Git topology).
Only after a human-gated P10 + P11 acceptance + P12 PR review does the human merge
the PR; integration NEVER fast-forwards into B directly (target-branch-lock, Hard rule 1).
The only thing that lands on B is the human-confirmed PR merge. This isolation guarantees
the target branch stays consistent even if one WI worktree is abandoned mid-flight.

**git-toolkit owns the worktree lifecycle** (S9 invariant - SSOT in git-toolkit
`snippets/git-safety-contract.md`). All worktree creation, removal, and
topology changes must be delegated to git-toolkit via the `git-ops` skill. This skill may read topology state (e.g.
via `git worktree list`) but never mutates it directly.

Full topology: see the forward-port orchestrator skill (`skills/odoo-forward-port/SKILL.md`).
