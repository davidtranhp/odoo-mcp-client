## Role

Odoo instance lifecycle coordinator. Front door for ALL instance lifecycle operations (create,
drop, park, resume, init, update, run-tests, ensure-up, status, load-language) for every Odoo
series the index carries - resolve that set with `list_available_versions()`, never from a
remembered floor.
Keeps the caller's context clean by delegating shell-level work and relaying a structured result
block. Programmatic twin of the interactive `/odoo-setup` command (the human declare-and-spinup
wizard that writes `instances.toml`): use this skill when the caller already knows the operation
parameters - hand them over, get back a structured `instance-ops` block.

**Single owner of instance provisioning.** This skill is the SINGLE PLACE that OWNS Odoo instance
fan-out: any component needing a live instance routes here via the Skill tool instead of driving
the lifecycle itself, so the L2 human gate, instance-allocation rules, and HARD RULES (`en_US`
union, Viindoo `to_base`, the GATE_ROLE-conditioned lint-module install, per-version `cli_help`
grounding) are enforced in one place. **When the caller is a declared HARD LEAF (`agents.<name>.role == leaf` in the
agent-role SSOT, `generator/skill_tool_deps.json`), this skill MUST provision INLINE (see "Inline
leaf-mode" below) and MUST NOT launch the `odoo-instance-ops` agent** - inline leaf-mode is
mandatory for a leaf caller, not a judgment call. For a spawner/coordinator/skill caller, provision
the way that fits the caller's context - run the ops steps INLINE in the caller's own context (see
"Inline leaf-mode" below), or launch the `odoo-instance-ops` agent per "Brief shape" below; this
skill is the component that owns launching that agent. However the
operation is carried out, the SAME HARD RULES apply - the inline path is not a bypass. A provided
`INSTANCE_HANDLE` ALWAYS wins over self-provisioning either way (contract:
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/instance-handle-contract.md`). `scripts/lib/allocator.py` is never
how a caller PROVISIONS an instance: both paths below reach it only after running the HARD RULES,
so an acquire that routed around this skill is an acquire that skipped them. Tearing your OWN
lease down at your terminal status - releasing or parking it - is not provisioning and is run
directly, per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/resource-teardown-contract.md` T1.

The `odoo-instance-ops` agent runs at a flat `sonnet` tier when launched - there is no
per-operation model-tier table.

## Dispatch

When invoked, gather the following from the caller's request:

| Parameter | Values / notes |
|-----------|----------------|
| `operation` | `create` / `drop` / `park` / `resume` / `init` / `update` / `run-tests` / `ensure-up` / `status` / `load-language` |
| `series` | e.g. `17.0`, `18.0` - required for create/init/update/run-tests/resume; optional for status |
| `lease_token` | required for `park` - the token of the lease to suspend (the `lease_token` field of the `INSTANCE_HANDLE` being finished with). Not used by any other operation |
| `park_ttl_s` | optional for `park` - how long the suspended database is kept before the allocator reclaims it. Omitted keeps the allocator's default; the budget is DISK-scoped, so state it in the relay when the caller did not name one |
| `persist` | What a CALLER may request: `ephemeral` (default) / `exclusive-running` / `shared-running`. What each one means, plus the `exclusive-parked` state a suspended instance sits in (park keeps its db + ports; resume brings it back), is spelled out in ONE place - `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/reference/INSTANCE-ALLOCATION-MODES.md` § 5 - and is deliberately NOT restated here; read it there before choosing. The one consequence this dispatch table must state itself, because it decides whether a caller may safely run mutating work: an `exclusive-running` instance never converges on `8069` (its port comes from the allocator pool), a `shared-running` one is shared by every reader on that series |
| `run_id` | the caller's session/run id - threaded into every brief and forwarded to the allocator as the lease owner. NEVER omit it: an unowned live lease is what lets another session drop yours |
| `PROFILE` | Tenant profile name, e.g. `viindoo_17`; this skill resolves it per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/project-facts-resolution.md` (rung 2 returns the exact declared `profile` for the `[[instance]]` covering this repo - use it verbatim, never invent or abbreviate it) and threads it through - the caller never sets this manually. Judge the FACT, not the instance match: rung 2 exits 0 and returns an EMPTY `INST_PROFILE` when the matched `[[instance]]` declares no `profile` key, so "an instance covers this repo" and "that instance names a profile" are DIFFERENT conditions. An empty value counts as rung 2 not having answered THIS fact - fall through to the rungs below, and if none names one, OMIT the field entirely rather than send `PROFILE: ''`. A sibling fact stays authoritative regardless: an empty `INST_PROFILE` never discards `INST_SERIES`. REQUIRED input for the agent's `to_base`/lint-module HARD RULEs below - when omitted, the agent resolves the series' vanilla profile itself or BLOCKs rather than probe unprofiled |
| `modules` | comma-separated or list; required for `init` / `update` / `run-tests`. A caller driving a plan node passes that node's `modules` list here |
| `demo` | `on` / `off` (default `off`) |
| `test_tags` | `run-tests` scope selector - the OTHER half of `modules` (`-i`/`-u` builds the registry, `test_tags` decides whose tests run). Pass the caller's resolved blast radius, normally `/<m>` per module in `modules` (e.g. `/sale,/account`), narrowable to a class or method (`/module.ClassName.method_name`) for a focused re-run. `full` = run untagged ON PURPOSE (release sweep, CI/Runbot parity, no-code-change smoke) - an explicit declaration, not a blank. OMITTED / `none` = not supplied, and the agent DERIVES `/<m>` per module rather than running untagged; a `-i sale --test-enable` with no tags runs every installed module's suite from `base` up, which is the defect this field exists to prevent. Contract: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/test-scope-contract.md`; which modules belong in the set: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/regression-scope.md` |
| `GATE_ROLE` | `pre-pr-lint-gate` / `node-verify` - REQUIRED for `run-tests`, and any `init`/`update` dispatch whose purpose is running automated tests via `--test-enable`; decides whether the dispatched agent unions `test_lint`/`test_pylint` into the install list + `--test-tags` at all (see "Agent-side unions this skill does not compute itself" below). `pre-pr-lint-gate` is reserved for the ONE run-level pre-PR lint-class gate (`run-harness`'s pre-PR tail states it explicitly); every OTHER test-run caller (a node verification run, a leaf's own RED-test confirmation, an ad-hoc human "run the tests" request) is `node-verify`. This skill resolves it before dispatch - see the resolution rule below - so the agent never receives an unresolved value |
| `mode` | `fresh` / `reuse` (default `fresh`; `run-tests` only) - auto `reuse` when reusing an INSTANCE_HANDLE whose DB already has the modules installed, else `fresh`; `fresh` -> `-i` (init+test on a new DB), `reuse` -> `-u` (re-run where `-i` would be a no-op) |
| `log_mode` | `info` / `debug` / `sql` (optional; `run-tests` only) - overrides the odoo log verbosity for this run; omitted keeps the default below. `warn` is REFUSED - it hides the pass summary |
| `fresh_venv` | `true` / `false` (default `false` - reuse existing venv when present) |
| `languages` | csv locale codes (e.g. `vi_VN,fr_FR`); required for `load-language`; optional for `create` / `init` - this skill ALWAYS unions `en_US` into the activation set before dispatch (see "en_US is mandatory on every build" below), so the caller never needs to add it; omit / pass `none` to activate `en_US` alone |
| `skip_auto_install` | `true` / `false` (default `false`; forced `true` when `context=doc`) - adds `--skip-auto-install` so `auto_install` modules do not install alongside the target |
| `context` | `doc` / `default` (default `default`; `doc` auto-sets `demo=on` + `skip_auto_install=true` for a clean documentation instance) |
| `mode_hint` | `path-incremental` / `default` (default `default`; `path-incremental` signals the agent to keep the EXCLUSIVE lease alive across a sequential delta-install loop on ONE DB - do not release between steps; set by `odoo-doc-planner` / `module-packaging` workflow for dependency-cluster doc; do not set manually unless acting as a doc-planner) |
| `WORKTREE_PATH` | (optional) absolute path to the worktree whose code this instance must load. When set, the addons list passed to the allocator is re-rooted onto it per § WORKTREE_PATH substitution below, so a verification run cannot silently load the principal checkout. Omit for a catalog-tree instance |

Anything the caller omits that is strictly required for the operation: ask ONE clarifying
question covering all missing required parameters before dispatching.

**`park` vs `drop` - decide on a fact about the DATABASE, never on convenience.** Both stop the
same server process group and free the same RAM. `park` KEEPS the database, filestore and ports so
a later `resume` picks the instance up where it was; `drop` destroys the database. A caller who is
finished with the instance FOR NOW but still wants its data asks for `park` - never `drop`, and
never a `drop` dispatch in the hope it will be declined. `resume` brings a parked instance back on
its own coordinates, so it never rebuilds and never installs modules.

**`GATE_ROLE` resolution (mandatory, resolved by THIS skill before dispatch - never left for the
agent to guess).** For any `run-tests` (or test-enable `init`/`update`) request: an explicit value
already present in the caller's context (e.g. an orchestrating caller like `run-harness`'s pre-PR
tail, or `odoo-coder`'s node coordinator, stating its own role) always wins - forward it
verbatim. For a direct/human-initiated invocation with no stated role ("run the tests for the
account module", eval #2), default to `GATE_ROLE: node-verify` and state the assumption - an
ad-hoc human test run is NEVER the run's ONE designated pre-PR lint gate, so this default never
risks silently reinstating the lint-class gate the pre-PR tail owns. Only forward
`GATE_ROLE: pre-pr-lint-gate` when the caller explicitly identifies itself as that ONE gate - never
inferred from module count, phrasing, or any other proxy. This resolution happens HERE so the
dispatched `odoo-instance-ops` agent always receives a resolved `GATE_ROLE` and never has to guess
on this skill's behalf (its own contract refuses with `NEEDS_CONTEXT` if it ever does see one
missing - see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/odoo-instance-ops.md` "Lint modules - installed ONLY
for the designated pre-PR lint gate (HARD RULE)").

**Log verbosity default.** Every build (`create` / `init` / `update` / `run-tests`) runs at
`--log-level=info` - Odoo's stock default, and the lowest level at which a PASSING run still emits
its own summary. Override per dispatch: `run-tests` via `log_mode`; the rest via a `--log-level` in
the brief's extra flags, which is placed after the default and therefore wins. The agent grounds
`--log-level` via `cli_help` like any other flag.

**Active-wait on long builds (relay).** A `create` / `init` / `update` / `run-tests` build can run
upto ten hours (depending on number of modules to run tests) that seems to be longer than the foreground
tool timeout. The dispatched `odoo-instance-ops` agent MUST launch the
build in the background, capture `LOG_PATH`, then BLOCK in the FOREGROUND on
`55-instance-ops.sh wait-log --log "<LOG_PATH>"` as its VERY NEXT tool call - never backgrounding
that call, and never ending its turn on a text-only "waiting for the build" reply. The Bash tool's
generic "you will be notified, do not poll" default never holds for a dispatched agent ANYWHERE and
is explicitly OVERRIDDEN here as everywhere (SSOT:
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/spawner-completion-contract.md` § A background shell command is a
SAME-TURN result): it
blocks and RETURNS `BUILD_RESULT=success|failure|inconclusive|timeout`, and no notification resumes
a dispatched agent's ended turn. `timeout` is the ONLY one that means keep waiting -> re-invoke the
same foreground call while `BUILD_PROGRESS` (the
per-poll composite progress reading, emitted on every call) MOVES from the previous wait's value;
`BLOCKED` with `LOG_PATH` preserved only once a whole window leaves a NON-EMPTY reading
byte-identical, and that report says the wait could not separate a stopped build from a hung one.
`inconclusive` means the run FINISHED and refused to certify a pass (its tag filter matched no test,
or every matched test was skipped): never wait again on it and never relay it as green - it carries
the run's own `TEST_RESULT=inconclusive` and is handled as that verdict, with `findings_path` and
`log_path` surfaced and the caller held back from merge or the next phase.
A non-zero exit is ALWAYS a failure, for every verb. SUCCESS is per-verb and the two rules are NOT
interchangeable: `create`/`init`/`update` need exit 0 AND the `Modules loaded.` completion marker
AND no failure marker; `run-tests` needs the run's OWN `TEST_RESULT=` line, and `Modules loaded.`
is only PROGRESS there - Odoo logs it BEFORE the post-install suite starts, so it can never certify
a tested build.
Full contract (markers, heartbeat, reaped-launcher rule):
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/odoo-instance-ops.md` "Active-wait on long builds".

**Readiness/completion signal is DETERMINISTIC, never a log tail.** One signal per job shape. An
install/update job is DONE when the launched process EXITS (`--stop-after-init` guarantees this),
confirmed by exit 0 AND the forced `Modules loaded.` completion marker AND no failure marker - exit
0 ALONE is NOT proof of install (a bad module name, an unresolved dependency, or a failed demo load
can each exit 0 while silently skipping it). A LISTENING instance is READY on a BOUNDED-timeout HTTP
port poll - primary `/web/database/selector`, fallback `/web/login` - never a log line. Full
contract: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/odoo-instance-ops.md` "Deterministic completion contract"
and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/reference/INSTANCE-LIFECYCLE-BUILD-CONTRACT.md` item 14.

**`en_US` is mandatory on every build - independent of caller input.** `en_US` is Odoo's
base/source language. Every `create`, `init`, and `run-tests` (`mode: fresh`) dispatch MUST activate
it in the target DB. Before building the brief, compute
`activation_languages = {"en_US"} union languages` (omitted / `none` = empty set) and pass that
UNIONED csv as the brief's `LANGUAGES:` field. This BUILD-TIME guarantee is owned entirely by this skill - no downstream consumer
(translation, doc capture, QA, module reload) may find `en_US` missing. `odoo-i18n` unions `en_US`
into its own activation set too (recipe KT3) because it issues `--load-language` / `i18n loadlang`
directly against `odoo-bin` OUTSIDE this skill's dispatch - a second, independent enforcement point,
not a duplicate.

**Agent-side unions this skill does not compute itself.** This skill resolves `PROFILE` (per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/project-facts-resolution.md`; an empty resolved value is treated as
unanswered and the field is omitted, never sent empty) and threads it into the brief. The
dispatched `odoo-instance-ops` agent then PINS that profile (`set_active_profile` + explicit
`profile_name=` on every probe - never profile-less, and never with an empty `profile_name`: an
absent `PROFILE` field is what triggers the agent's own vanilla-profile resolution) and performs two further DATA-DRIVEN unions
before building the `odoo-bin` command, on top of the `en_US` union above:
- **Viindoo `to_base` on `--load`.** Callers pass nothing extra for this one - it is unconditional
  for every `create`/`init`/`update`/`run-tests` build. The agent pins the resolved profile (brief `PROFILE`, or the series'
  vanilla profile when absent, or `NEEDS_CONTEXT`) then checks it for `to_base`; when present, it
  unions `to_base` into the server-wide `--load` list (never as an ordinary `-i`) - see
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/odoo-instance-ops.md` "Server-wide modules (`--load`) - Viindoo
  `to_base` (HARD RULE)".
- **Lint modules for `run-tests` - GATED, never unconditional.** This union is NOT automatic like
  `to_base` above - it fires ONLY when this dispatch's `GATE_ROLE` (resolved above) is
  `pre-pr-lint-gate`. For that ONE role, the agent reuses the pinned profile to probe for
  `test_lint`/`test_pylint` and unions every present one into BOTH the `-i`/`-u` install list and
  `--test-tags`. For `GATE_ROLE: node-verify` (every node verification run
  and every leaf self-provision), the agent does NOT probe, install, or tag either
  module at all - a `test_lint`/`test_pylint` violation in that dispatch's own module is caught
  ONLY at the run's designated pre-PR gate, never as a per-node `tests-failed` blocker. A
  `run-tests`/test-enable dispatch reaching the agent with `GATE_ROLE` still unresolved refuses with
  `NEEDS_CONTEXT` rather than guess either way. Full contract:
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/odoo-instance-ops.md` "Lint modules - installed ONLY for the
  designated pre-PR lint gate (HARD RULE)" and
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/reference/ODOO-TESTING.md` "Install the lint modules (not just tag them)".
  Installing and tagging them is not proof their checkers ran: a clean counter set on a
  `pre-pr-lint-gate` dispatch is NOT `tests-passed` until the agent's own coverage confirmation
  clears too (SSOT: `agents/odoo-instance-ops.md` "Checker-load coverage confirmation").

**Config isolation.** No operation writes to a shared or default config path - the CLI-flag path
reads no config file, the generated-conf path is a unique temp file per run; see
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/reference/INSTANCE-ALLOCATION-GUARDS.md` §6.2 Config-file isolation for
the full two-path contract.

**Human gate (instance_touching = L2):** Instance lifecycle is `instance_touching` - an L2 human
gate applies before any mutation (create, drop, init, update, run-tests). If a run-harness is in the
brief, do NOT bypass it; let the driver surface it. For a direct invocation, confirm the mutation
with the human before launching the agent. `park` and `resume` are deliberately OUTSIDE that set:
parking destroys nothing and is a teardown exit a dispatched worker must be able to take at its own
terminal status, and resuming re-launches an instance the run already holds a lease on.

**Brief shape:** Launch the `odoo-instance-ops` agent with a worker brief per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/worker-brief.md`. When composing the dispatch prompt for any
specialist agent you dispatch, fill the caller-side skeleton in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/dispatch-brief.md` (read it by path) plus the target agent's
family delta; never inline that file verbatim into a hard-leaf brief. The brief must include:

```
OPERATION: <operation>
SERIES: <series or 'unspecified'>
PROFILE: <the NON-EMPTY profile name this skill already resolved before composing this brief;
  omit the field entirely when the resolved value is empty or no rung named one -
  never emit PROFILE: '' and never forward a pointer for the agent to go re-resolve>
MODULES: <comma-separated list or 'none'>
DEMO: <on|off>
TEST_TAGS: <the resolved scope tags (normally `/<m>` per module in MODULES), or 'full' to run
  untagged on purpose; 'none'/omitted means NOT SUPPLIED and the agent derives `/<m>` per module -
  it never means "run every installed module's suite">
GATE_ROLE: <pre-pr-lint-gate|node-verify>   # REQUIRED for run-tests / test-enable init/update; resolved above - never omitted, never left for the agent to guess
MODE: <fresh|reuse>           # run-tests only; auto reuse when reusing an INSTANCE_HANDLE whose DB has the modules, else fresh
LOG_MODE: <info|debug|sql or 'default'>   # run-tests only; 'default' keeps the build default
FRESH_VENV: <true|false>
PERSIST: <ephemeral|exclusive-running|shared-running>   # create only; default ephemeral - see the dispatch table above
LEASE_TOKEN: <token of the lease to suspend>            # park only - REQUIRED there, omitted everywhere else
PARK_TTL_S: <seconds or 'default'>                      # park only; 'default' keeps the allocator's own budget
RUN_ID: <the caller's session/run id>                   # ALWAYS set - the lease-ownership identity; never omit
HUMAN_GATE: instance_touching - L2 gate applies to all mutations
LANGUAGES: <csv locales - ALWAYS unioned with en_US per the build rule above; 'none' -> en_US alone>
SKIP_AUTO_INSTALL: <true|false>
CONTEXT: <doc|default>
MODE_HINT: <path-incremental|default>
WORKTREE_PATH: <absolute worktree path, or 'none'>   # when set, the agent's own acquire gains --addons-path-override per § WORKTREE_PATH substitution
SHARE_DIR: <the run's captured absolute SHARE path - substitute it, never re-resolve>
ISOLATE_DIR: <the run's captured absolute ISOLATE path - substitute it, never re-resolve; the agent appends the run worklog and must not key it on WORKTREE_PATH's own toplevel>
```

`INSTANCE_RESOLUTION`, `ALLOCATOR`, and `OSM_GROUNDING` are deliberately NOT brief fields: the
dispatched agent's own "Common preamble" (Steps A-D) and port-flag tie-break own that procedure end
to end, keyed off `SERIES`/`PERSIST`/`RUN_ID`/`WORKTREE_PATH` above. Never add a field whose value is
a procedure to follow rather than a value this skill already resolved.

### Resolving `modules` + `test_tags` for a `run-tests` with no plan node

A caller driving a plan node passes that node's `modules` list (authored by `odoo-planner` per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/regression-scope.md`) and the matching tags. For an AD-HOC run
- a human asking to test a change, a leaf confirming its own edit - resolve the same module set `M`
yourself before dispatching, in this order:

1. **Modules actually changed.** Map the working tree's changed files to their owning modules: the
   module is the nearest ancestor directory holding a module descriptor - glob for BOTH descriptor
   filenames, per the "Module manifest (descriptor) filename" row of
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/odoo-era-boundaries.md`, since matching one name alone silently
   finds nothing on the other era. Read the diff through `git-toolkit:git-ops`'s bounded-read
   allowlist (`git diff --name-only`), never a hand-run mutation.
2. **In-repo blast radius.** Add the modules in THIS repo whose own suites exercise a model the
   change touched, keeping only owners that live in the repo under test - core / out-of-repo owners
   are dominated by Odoo's own modules and carry near-zero regression signal for a local change. The
   coverage lookup, the ceiling, and the OSM-down degrade are single-sourced in
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/regression-scope.md` § Run-set - follow it there rather
   than re-deriving the query here.
3. **Both fields, from that one set.** Pass `MODULES: <M>` (dependency order) and `TEST_TAGS: /<m>`
   per module. Do NOT pass modules and leave the tags blank - that is the defect the `test_tags`
   row above describes.

When the request is explicitly a full sweep, or no code changed at all, pass `TEST_TAGS: full` and
say which exemption applies (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/test-scope-contract.md`).

### WORKTREE_PATH substitution (mechanical - run before `acquire`, never edit the catalog)

`WORKTREE_PATH: none` -> skip this section entirely; the catalog list is used as-is. Otherwise:

1. `WT=$(cd <WORKTREE_PATH> && pwd -P)` and
   `PRINCIPAL=$(git -C "$WT" rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)`; strip a trailing
   `/.git` from `$PRINCIPAL` to get the principal checkout root.
2. Start from the catalog addons list in `$ALLOC_ADDONS_PATH` order.
3. DROP every entry whose `pwd -P` equals `$PRINCIPAL` or lies under `$PRINCIPAL/`.
4. PREPEND one replacement per dropped entry, same relative suffix under `$WT`, same order
   (a dropped `$PRINCIPAL/addons` becomes `$WT/addons`; a dropped bare `$PRINCIPAL` becomes `$WT`).
5. Steps 3-4 dropped ZERO entries -> emit
   `BLOCKED(no catalog addons entry lies under <PRINCIPAL> - this worktree's modules were never on
   this instance's addons-path; declare the repo's addons dir via /odoo-setup)`. Do NOT proceed: a
   suite run on an addons path that cannot contain the edited module proves nothing.
6. Pass the result as `--addons-path-override "<comma-joined>"` on the `acquire` call. Core,
   enterprise, theme and every other non-repo entry is carried through untouched.

**Memory cap inheritance.** No separate brief field is needed: the dispatched `odoo-instance-ops`
agent's scripted odoo-bin launches (create/init/update/run-tests) carry the `ulimit -Sv` +
`--limit-memory-hard` guard automatically (sourced from `scripts/lib/resource_limits.sh`),
overridable via `ODOO_AI_LIMIT_MEMORY_HARD`. Policy SSOT (do not restate it here):
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/odoo-bin-resource-limits.md`.

**Relay the result:** Relay the agent's structured output block verbatim to the caller:

```instance-ops
op: <create-instance|drop-instance|park-instance|resume-instance|init-modules|update-modules|run-tests|ensure-up|status>
series: <X.Y>

js_failed_reported: <n or null>       # run-tests only; from JS_FAILED_REPORTED= - never added to `failed`, it counts other units
js_failed_tests: <n or null>          # run-tests only; from JS_FAILED_TESTS=
findings_path: <path or null> # run-tests only; from FINDINGS_PATH= (failures + warnings + skips file)
lease_token: <token or null>
status: <one value of the agent's own enum, relayed as-is - never a Continuation status>
notes: <short human-readable summary or error; run-tests: ALWAYS carries the scope figures + any out-of-scope verdict, see below>
```

This `instance-ops` block IS the canonical `INSTANCE_HANDLE` for the run: the orchestrator forwards
it (`db_name` / `http_port` / `db_port` / `addons_path` / `venv_python` / `lease_token` / `run_id`) as
an `INSTANCE_HANDLE:` field into every downstream code / test brief, and downstream agents consume
it instead of self-provisioning. Forwarding `db_port` and `run_id` (not just `http_port` and
`lease_token`) is what lets a later turn drop or release the right instance on the right Postgres
port under the right owner. Contract: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/instance-handle-contract.md`.

On the agent's Continuation `status: NEEDS_CONTEXT` (its `instance-ops` block reads `status: error`
on a refusal before launch), surface its `blocked_reason` and the refusal it quoted, then stop - do
not retry without the missing requirement.

**Scope transparency on every `run-tests` relay.** `auto_install` fan-out makes a run install far
more modules than `modules` names, so an UNTAGGED run's verdict can be decided by tests the dispatch
was not verifying. The run is BOUNDED to the declared scope (`test_tags` you passed, else the agent
derives `/<m>` per module in `modules`) and the result is REPORTED with the scope it was decided on -
both, never one instead of the other. What stays forbidden is narrowing BELOW the declared scope:
never drop a module in `modules` from the tags, and never add a `skip_auto_install` the caller did
not ask for, because suppressing tests the caller DID declare manufactures a false green. Relay
verbatim in `notes` the agent's tags-used + provenance and its scope figures (modules actually
loaded, tests actually run), plus its statement of any verdict decided by tests OUTSIDE the module
under verification; never summarize them away, and never report an out-of-scope `tests-failed` as
this module's own regression. SSOT: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/odoo-instance-ops.md` § Scope
transparency; the scoping-vs-suppression rule itself:
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/test-scope-contract.md`.

### Inline leaf-mode (dispatched leaf / subagent self-provision)

Run the ops steps INLINE in the caller's own context - without launching the `odoo-instance-ops`
agent. **MANDATORY, not a judgment call, when the caller is a declared HARD LEAF** (`agents.<name>.role
== leaf`) - a hard-leaf caller MUST get inline leaf-mode and this skill MUST NOT launch
`odoo-instance-ops` for it. For a spawner/coordinator/skill caller, use inline leaf-mode whenever
that fits the caller's situation better than launching the agent (see "Single owner of instance
provisioning" above and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/worker-brief.md`). This
lets a caller lacking an `INSTANCE_HANDLE` self-provision an isolated ephemeral DB directly, and -
unlike a raw `allocator.py` call - still under the HARD RULES.

A provided `INSTANCE_HANDLE` ALWAYS wins: if one is in the brief, consume it and do NOT provision
(contract: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/instance-handle-contract.md`). Only with NO handle does
the caller self-provision via this inline path.

Run these steps in order, honoring the SAME HARD RULES as the agent (single source: the
cross-referenced sections in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/odoo-instance-ops.md` - do NOT restate
them here):

1. **Acquire an isolated ephemeral lease** per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/concurrency-guard.md`
   § "Odoo instance allocation" (`scripts/lib/allocator.py acquire --mode ephemeral` -> a unique
   `ALLOC_DB_NAME` + ports; never reuse the single declared db/port for a mutation).
2. **Pin series + ground CLI flags** - `set_active_version` then `cli_help` per the agent's "Common
   preamble" Steps A-B (every flag from this series' `cli_help`, never from memory).
3. **Apply the HARD RULES** as the agent does - `en_US` union
   (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/odoo-instance-ops.md` "en_US - always loaded on every build"),
   Viindoo `to_base` union into `--load` (same file, "Server-wide modules (`--load`) - Viindoo
   `to_base` (HARD RULE)"), and lint-module install for a test-run build ONLY when `GATE_ROLE:
   pre-pr-lint-gate` (same file, "Lint modules - installed ONLY for the designated pre-PR lint gate
   (HARD RULE)"). A HARD LEAF self-provisioning here (e.g. `odoo-test-writer` confirming RED via a
   live run) is never the run's designated pre-PR lint gate, so it always self-resolves
   `GATE_ROLE: node-verify` per the resolution rule above before this step - it never installs
   or tags `test_lint`/`test_pylint`. Resolve + PIN the profile before any probe; never probe
   profile-less.
4. **Run the operation** via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup-steps/55-instance-ops.sh`
   (`init` / `update` / `test` / `drop`) with resolved flags in `--extra`, applying the active-wait
   contract above - background launch, then a FOREGROUND `wait-log --log "<LOG_PATH>"` as the very
   next tool call; never idle-stall, and report the same run-tests scope figures.
5. **Clear the lease** when done, by ONE of the three exits - release it, park it
   (`allocator.py park <token>`) when the database is still wanted, or forward the handle to a
   NAMED catcher in `next.inputs` (`INSTANCE_HANDLE`, naming the skill that needs the live state).
   A lease left on none of the three at your terminal status is a leak, not a valid handoff. Full
   rule: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/resource-teardown-contract.md` T0/T1/T4. Whichever exit
   you take, emit the same `instance-ops` block used when the agent is launched instead, so the
   caller consumes an identical handle either way.

The L2 human gate still applies to any mutation via this path (see "Human gate"): if a run-harness
is present let the driver surface it, else confirm the mutation with the human first.

### Multi-instance parallel provisioning

The allocator issues each concurrent caller an independent ephemeral lease (distinct `db_name` +
port pool). Safe cap is ~3 simultaneous ephemeral instances before RAM / port-pool pressure; the
allocator enforces port uniqueness but imposes no count ceiling - the orchestrator manages the
budget. Use `CONTEXT: doc` for clean documentation instances (demo on + skip-auto-install; target
module only). For browser-bound capture workers, cap W at the number of distinct browser server
families available; state-mutating scenario drives stay <= 2 simultaneous. Browser-free phases (feature-map, icon, copy) fan out wider. Never
`createdb`/`dropdb` raw - always through Odoo and the allocator. `W` is per-family, RAM-permitting
(never a global single-flight across families): `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/concurrency-guard.md`
§ Browser exclusivity is the SSOT for the `W` number; full exclusivity rule + rationale:
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/resource-teardown-contract.md` T2.

## Out of Scope

- **Writing or reviewing application code** - route to `odoo-coding` or `odoo-code-review`
- **Debugging application logic or runtime errors** - route to `odoo-debug`
- **Designing a technical solution** - route to `odoo-solution-design`
- **Translating a module** - route to `odoo-i18n`
- **Interactive declare-and-spinup of `instances.toml`** - that is `/odoo-setup` (human wizard);
  this skill is for programmatic dispatch where the caller already knows the parameters

## Standalone-first fallback

When OSM (the `odoo-semantic-mcp` server) is unreachable, the dispatched `odoo-instance-ops` agent
reads per-version CLI flags directly from `odoo-bin --help` on the live binary. Provisioning never
degrades - only OSM-grounded CLI discovery falls back locally.

When no instance or venv exists, the agent builds one from scratch: discover/create a Python venv
for the target series via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup-steps/45-venv.sh create-venv --series
<X.Y> [--profile <name>] --tool uv` (installs requirements and validates `odoo-bin --version` - not
a bare `import odoo`), then run `odoo-bin` with the operation's flags.

When no `instances.toml` and no allocator are reachable, the agent surfaces one
`status: needs-context` block listing exactly what is missing (addons path, DB host, series binary
location) rather than guessing.

For `load-language`: when OSM is unreachable the agent reads the per-version language-loading flag
from `odoo-bin --help` and proceeds; the `res.lang` active-verification step (needs the live Odoo
MCP) is skipped and flagged `grounded: log-signal (not live-verified)` in the output notes.

## MCP tools

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED TOOLS -->
> **Pick the right tool first.** Odoo Semantic (the odoo-semantic-mcp server) is the INDEXED Odoo source-code knowledge graph: a pre-built graph + vector index of Odoo source across every indexed Odoo version (legacy through latest) and repos/editions, with inheritance, override, and cross-module impact already resolved. It gives AUTHORITATIVE STRUCTURAL facts about how Odoo source IS DEFINED, with no local checkout needed. Unique signature: indexed, cross-version, inheritance-resolved, whole-graph, checkout-free. It is a STATIC index with NO runtime/live data.
>
> This is your PRIMARY, context-efficient source for Odoo source/structure questions - the Odoo codebase is huge and reading it directly burns context, so prefer Odoo Semantic first. Order of precedence: (1) Odoo Semantic available -> use it; (2) available but it lacks the specific detail -> THEN read the source (Read/Grep your checkout) to fill that gap; (3) unavailable -> read the source. Reading code is the FALLBACK, never the first move when Odoo Semantic can answer.
>
> Do NOT use Odoo Semantic for:
> - LIVE DATA / runtime - actual record values, search/read/write real records, executing a method, this instance's installed modules -> use a live Odoo MCP server (one exposing read_record/search_records/execute_method), NOT Odoo Semantic.
>
> Look-live-but-static tools (return indexed source, never runtime data): `model_inspect`, `module_inspect`, `entity_lookup`, `validate_domain`, `validate_depends`, `validate_relation`, `describe_module`, `check_module_exists`, `resolve_orm_chain`. These tool names look like they query a live instance but return indexed source data only. If you need live records, Odoo Semantic is the wrong server.

**Session bootstrap** (call once at session start):
- `set_active_profile(profile_name='<profile from the resolved instance entry>')` - Pin tenant profile for the session so subsequent calls scope to one customer profile.
- `set_active_version(odoo_version='17.0')` - Pin a CONCRETE Odoo version (sentinels like 'auto' are rejected; the call doubles as a cheap reachability probe; 24h idle TTL).

**Primary tools:**
- `check_module_exists` - Verify module availability, edition (CE/EE/Viindoo), and cross-version presence.
- `cli_help` - Look up odoo-bin subcommand flags, their status, and replacement for deprecated flags.
- `list_available_versions` ☆ - Enumerate which Odoo versions the server has indexed.
- `profile_inspect` - Profile-level introspection discriminator (ADR-0028): inspect a tenant profile's composition in one call.
