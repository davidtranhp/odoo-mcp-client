# Forward-Port Pipeline - per-phase execution detail

All paths are under the integration worktree unless noted. `<slug>` derives from the
source/target series (`<source-series>-to-<target-series>`). Artifacts live under
`<ISOLATE_DIR>/forward-port/<slug>/` (gitignored; resolve `<SHARE_DIR>`/`<ISOLATE_DIR>` once per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/state-root-resolution.md`; substitute the captured absolute path -
never write the placeholder or a bare `.odoo-ai/` into a Read/Write/Edit). Every Odoo Semantic call passes a concrete
`odoo_version=` (never a default; the pin is session-scoped state any other actor sharing this
session can overwrite - SSOT: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/concurrency-guard.md` §
OSM session-pin race).

---

## P0 - Recon & triage (read-only, NO stop)

```bash
# 0 - resolve the ISOLATE state dir once for this run
DIR="$(bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/resolve_project_dir.sh" isolate)"

# 1 - resume: read prior state, skip done commits
cat "$DIR/forward-port/<slug>/checkpoint.json" 2>/dev/null   # {<sha>: status}

# 2 - enumerate the commits to forward (read-only; no worktree, no branch yet)
# Same-repo (both refs on origin): compute merge-base locally
MB=$(git merge-base <target-branch> <source-ref>)
# Cross-repo: invoke git-ops (add source remote + fetch), then compute:
#   MB=$(git merge-base <target-branch> source/<branch>)
# Invoke git-ops: enumerate commits (--no-merges, range MB..<source-ref>,
#   apply --scope <paths> / --since <date>); git-ops writes the commit list.
```

Map each `--scope` module name to its directory path before requesting git-ops to filter
by path (module `l10n_vn` -> `l10n_vn/`; resolve via manifest location - may be at repo root
or under an addons subdir, e.g. `addons/l10n_vn/`).

**Group by module first (R2a).** Invoke `git-toolkit:git-ops` (read-only) to list touched files
per commit (`--name-only`) for every commit in the range, then map each touched path to its owning
module (same resolution rule as `--scope` above). Build `module -> [ordered sha list]`
(chronological, oldest first); a commit touching 3 modules appears in each of the 3 modules' lists
(shared reference, never duplicated). This map is what P1 dispatches over.

For each MODULE's commit bundle, triage the EXTRACT tier INLINE (`git show --stat <sha>` for every
commit in the bundle; for an override-depth question, one `find_override_point` probe) per
`references/fp-triage-table.md` Table 1 - the tier is the HIGHEST-priority row any commit in the
bundle matches; the orchestrator triages the tier itself; never dispatch an agent to decide a
dispatch.

This is recon only. There is NO approval gate here, NO `plan.md` written, NO branch, NO worktree -
the plan gate is P4 (Plan Mode), after intent + classify + design. Write the per-commit EXTRACT tier
and the range facts to `<ISOLATE_DIR>/recon/<slug>-<date>/findings.md` per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/scouting-persistence-contract.md` (each commit's row carries the
tier its module's bundle resolved to, per the module-bundle grouping above), then READ that file back at the
start of P1 rather than relying on this phase's text still being in context - a resumed
run must not re-triage the range.

---

## P1 - Intent extract (PARALLEL, READ-ONLY, MODULE-SCOPED)

**BAN (R2b): dispatch ONE `odoo-intent-extractor` per MODULE, never per commit.** Walk the P0
`module -> [ordered sha list]` map; for each module, launch exactly one subagent - real tool calls,
never narrated - carrying that module's FULL ordered commit list. Set BOTH the `model` parameter
(the module bundle's triaged EXTRACT tier, per `references/fp-triage-table.md` Table 1) and the
brief. Concurrency: Mode B budget (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/concurrency-guard.md`
- the budget counts MODULES in flight, not commits); rolling-window beyond the budget. No child
worktree - extraction is read-only on git history + OSM. A second instance for a module already
dispatched this run, WHILE the first is still live or already succeeded, is a defect; resume the
SAME instance by the id its own launch returned (CHP Tier-A) for a failed or incomplete pass.
**Tier-C (no recorded id, or it no longer resolves):** once the failed/incomplete instance's turn has fully ended, dispatch
ONE superseding `general-purpose` worker carrying the SAME full `commit_dump_paths` plus `PRIOR
ATTEMPT: <failure detail>` - a replacement, never a second concurrent instance. Full rule: `SKILL.md`
§ P1.

Pre-step (once before the parallel dispatch): invoke the `git-toolkit:git-ops` skill (via the Skill tool; read-only, no worktree)
in a batch pass to write per-commit dump files. For each commit SHA in the range:

- op: full-patch commit show (full message + diff) for the sha
- `output: <ISOLATE_DIR>/forward-port/<slug>/commits/<sha>.dump`
- `repo: <main-checkout-root>` (cross-repo ports only; source commits live only in the main
  checkout after the P0 source-remote add+fetch)

Collect the `{ <sha>: <abs-path> }` map before dispatching any extractor, then group it BY MODULE
using the P0 `module -> [ordered sha list]` map to build each module's `commit_dump_paths`. Every
extractor brief MUST include `commit_dump_paths` (the module's ordered map) from this grouping;
the extractor mandates this field for its P1 bulk-sweep use and never runs git itself.

**SLUG is PER-MODULE here, never the bare run slug (closes the B2 shared-commit write race).** R2a's
module map and R2b's per-module cap together mean a commit shared between modules A and B is
intentionally dispatched to BOTH modules' single extractor instances - two independent instances
legitimately process the identical SHA, and would otherwise both write the SAME `intents/<sha>.md`
path with no owner or merge rule. Set this brief's `SLUG` field to `<slug>/<module>` (the run
`<slug>` plus this module's own name) - the extractor's own write-path template
(`agents/odoo-intent-extractor.md` Step 3, `<ISOLATE_DIR>/forward-port/<slug>/intents/<sha>.md`,
substituted verbatim from this field) then resolves per module automatically, with no change needed
to that agent: module A's instance writes `<ISOLATE_DIR>/forward-port/<run-slug>/A/intents/<sha>.md`;
module B's writes `.../B/intents/<sha>.md` for the SAME sha - two distinct files, each module's own
perspective, never a last-write-wins collision. `commit_dump_paths` below is UNCHANGED - those are
already-resolved absolute paths the orchestrator wrote ONCE (single writer, shared read-only),
keyed by the run-level `<slug>`, never per-module.

Brief (run-specific inputs only - the agent's system prompt owns every procedure):

```
DISPATCH MODEL: <extract-tier>            # the MODULE bundle's tier, per Table 1
MODULE: <module-name>
commit_dump_paths:
  <sha1>: <ISOLATE_DIR>/forward-port/<slug>/commits/<sha1>.dump
  <sha2>: <ISOLATE_DIR>/forward-port/<slug>/commits/<sha2>.dump
  # ... every sha touching this module, oldest first (run-level <slug> - shared, read-only, single writer)
SOURCE SERIES: <e.g. 16.0>
SLUG: <slug>/<module>              # PER-MODULE namespace for THIS extractor's own intents/ writes only
TASK: For EACH commit in commit_dump_paths (in order), extract the business intent + behavioral
      contract. Read commit message -> PR/issue -> test changes -> code comments (in that
      priority). OSM-ground the touched symbols at the SOURCE version. Write ONE
      <ISOLATE_DIR>/forward-port/<slug>/intents/<sha>.md per commit (the module-scoped <slug>
      above, so this module's write path never collides with another module's for a shared sha).
      Note any overlap or revert
      between commits in this SAME module bundle. Do NOT copy diff hunks as intent. Do NOT
      classify the 4-outcome bucket (caller's job).
USER LANGUAGE: <lang | omit when English>
```

Aggregate every returned summary (`sha / intent_file / intent_one_liner / symbols /
4_outcome_hint / grounding` - one per commit, all returned from the module's single dispatch;
`intent_file` is that module's own module-scoped path per the SLUG substitution above, so
P2/P3/8a/8b read THAT returned path rather than reconstructing one from the bare run `<slug>`) into
the P2 classify queue. Mark each commit `status=extracted` in `checkpoint.json`.

---

## P2 - Classify + installable-probe (module-first order, per-commit bucket, OSM)

Walk modules in the SAME order the P0/P1 map established, and within each module walk its commits
in that module's own order (R2a) - the bucket decision below stays per-commit.

```python
set_active_version(odoo_version='17.0')                          # pin target; reachability probe
api_version_diff(symbol='account.move._post', from_version='16.0', to_version='17.0')
model_inspect(model='account.move', method='summary', odoo_version='17.0')
```

Assign exactly one bucket a/b/c/d per `[[fp-intent-4outcome]]` (read it - do not re-derive the
definitions). Append one row per commit to `merge-log.md` (intent / bucket / reason / evidence -
no blank Reason or Evidence cell). C3 escalations use the canonical row
`<sha> | C3 | source issue <ref|DEFERRED> | <evidence one-liner>`. `odoo-version-diff` forward-port mode supplies the per-symbol
bucket suggestion when the diff is large. Refine the commit's ADAPT tier now that the bucket is
known (bucket a/d -> haiku, test-only).

**Installable-probe (TARGET CLEAN-TIP rule).** For each touched module, resolve its `installable` flag
at the target clean-tip (BEFORE merge) by reading `<module>/<tgt-descriptor>` at `target_ref` - written
by git-ops (read-only) to `manifest_path` in the pre-step below, which now runs for EVERY touched
module, not only before a dispatch. `<tgt-descriptor>` and `<src-descriptor>` are the per-side
descriptor filenames SKILL.md Hard rule 11 resolved once (`__manifest__.py`, or `__openerp__.py` on
v8.0-v9.0); they can differ across a v9.0 -> v10.0 port. An absent `installable` key means installable
(Odoo convention); an absent FILE means the module is not on the clean tip - a conclusion only the
side's OWN descriptor filename can support.

DISPATCH the read-only sonnet leaf `odoo-installable-prober` only when the SOURCE HISTORY is also
needed to disambiguate category 3 - the module's manifest was NOT touched by the forwarded commit range and
its target state is unclear. The prober reads the manifest you wrote plus the history dump; it never
runs git and never calls OSM for this fact. Whether resolved directly (categories 1-2) or via the
prober (category 3), record `installable_false=yes|no` in `merge-log.md` for the module - the ONE
field any later phase reads for its installable state.

Pre-step (unconditional - runs for EVERY touched module, not only before a dispatch): invoke the `git-toolkit:git-ops` skill (via the Skill tool; read-only) to write two files. For
cross-repo ports include `repo: <main-checkout-root>` (source commits live only in the main
checkout after P0 bootstrap):

- `manifest_path`: read `<module>/<tgt-descriptor>` at `target_ref` and write to
  `<ISOLATE_DIR>/forward-port/<slug>/installable/<module>/manifest.py`
- `history_dump_path`: run a log-with-patch of manifest modifications (--follow --diff-filter=M
  on `<module>/<src-descriptor>` - the SOURCE side's name) against `source_ref` and write to
  `<ISOLATE_DIR>/forward-port/<slug>/installable/<module>/history.diff`

Assign the resulting absolute paths before launching the prober; the prober mandates both fields
and never runs git itself.

Dispatcher inputs (CANONICAL CONTRACT - pass exactly these keys):

```
{ module, repo_root, source_ref, target_ref, target_version, manifest_path, history_dump_path }
```

- `repo_root` is the MAIN checkout root where git runs. The integration worktree does NOT exist
  at P2 (it is created at P4) - never reference it here. For a same-repo forward-port `repo_root`
  is the main clone of the repo holding both refs; for a cross-repo port it is the main clone that
  has the source remote added + fetched in the P0 bootstrap step (git-ops adds the source remote
  + fetches). The dispatcher populates `repo_root` deterministically from the P0-recorded checkout
  root before launching the prober.
- `source_ref` / `target_ref` are the source / target git refs (the same refs P0 enumerated).
- `target_version` is the concrete target series for OSM grounding.
- `manifest_path` / `history_dump_path` are absolute paths to the surveyor-written files (see
  pre-step above).

The prober consumes those and returns BOTH:

- `merge_log_line:` - a single-line verdict logged VERBATIM to `merge-log.md`.
- a structured verdict block - `{ module, verdict: yes|no|tentative, evidence }`.

**merge-log row placement.** The prober verdict is its OWN row keyed by module, kept DISTINCT
from the per-commit rows (intent / bucket / reason / evidence). Place it under a dedicated
`## Installable probes` heading (one row per probed module) so a module-keyed verdict is never
confused with a commit-keyed classification row.

**TENTATIVE handling.** A `tentative` verdict is NEVER silently coerced to yes/no: carry it to
the P4 plan gate as a FLAGGED row requiring explicit human confirmation before that module's
merge. A `no` verdict means `installable:False` -> the module enters the lint-only lane and SKIPs
extract/adapt logic tiers. Do not restate the rule - SSOT: `[[fp-installable-false]]`.

---

## P3 - Design (conditional route-out)

A bucket-(c) "do now" commit that touches a NON-TRIVIAL module routes OUT to
`odoo-solution-design` instead of being adapted blind. Reuse the non-trivial criterion from
`skills/odoo-solution-design/SKILL.md` § When to invoke - do NOT invent a third definition. A
deferred or `installable:False` module needs no design - skip it.

Emit the Continuation Contract and YIELD (forward-port only EMITS the next hop; the run-harness
advances it):

**This block is the SSOT for the P3 payload** - `SKILL.md` P3 and its Continuation Contract
section both point here rather than restating it. Add a field only here.

```
next: odoo-solution-design
inputs:
  return_to: odoo-forward-port
  design_slug_hint: <slug>-fp-<sha>
  target_version: <target>
  modules: [<module-name>, ...]
  intent_records: [<ISOLATE_DIR>/forward-port/<slug>/<module>/intents/<sha>.md, ...]
    # one entry per module in `modules` above (§ P1 write path - each module's own
    # intent perspective on this sha), never the bare run-slug intents/<sha>.md
  classification: <bucket-(c) summary>
  design_proposals: [<verbatim finding line>, ...]
    # every structural change this pipeline may PROPOSE but never decide, carried verbatim
    # for the architect to accept or reject. Today exactly one producer: the P7 view-topology
    # `VIEW-TOPOLOGY | ... | action: merge-into-base | ...` finding line (see P7 below).
    # `[]` when there is none - the key is ALWAYS present, never omitted.
    # A `NEEDS-HUMAN` view-topology line NEVER travels here: it goes to the P10 human gate.
```

**Routing a proposal when no commit routes to P3.** A `merge-into-base` line can be raised on a
bucket-(b) commit that needs no design of its own. It still may not be applied unapproved: when
this batch emits no P3 hop, raise one whose `classification` reads
`view-topology proposal only (no bucket-(c) design)` and whose `modules` is the proposing module -
`design_proposals` is never dropped for want of a carrier.

`<slug>` is the run slug (`<source-series>-to-<target-series>`); `<sha>` the short SHA of the
routed commit. Together `design_slug_hint` gives the design agent a deterministic output path
(`<slug>-fp-<sha>`), so forward-port re-entry locates it without scanning.

`odoo-solution-design` under `return_to` runs its own design + design-approval gate, then emits
`next: odoo-forward-port` with `design_doc: <path>`; it does NOT enter a code Plan Mode and does
NOT dispatch a coder (SSOT: `skills/odoo-solution-design/SKILL.md` § Design-approval gate). On
re-entry, read `design_doc` from the returned contract's `inputs`, record it against the commit,
set checkpoint `status=designed`, and proceed to the P4 plan gate with the design linked - do
not re-run design. If `design_doc` is ABSENT from the returned inputs (design crashed before
producing it), set the commit back to `status=extracted` and re-enter P3 next run rather than
advancing to P4 with no design.

---

## P4 - Plan gate (Plan Mode)

The user approves here - AFTER intent + classify + design, so the plan carries the REAL triaged
tiers and REAL buckets, never guesses. Forward-port runs from the MAIN context, so it MAY drive
Plan Mode (a subagent cannot).

Plan-Mode enter/exit is the SHARED SSOT
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/planning-gate-contract.md` § Plan-Mode enter/exit + plan_mode_active
- forward-port REUSES it for this gate rather than defining its own: `EnterPlanMode` iff
`plan_mode_active` is absent/false (skip iff a caller already opened Plan Mode), present the plan,
`ExitPlanMode` on approve, user approves in the Plan Mode UI. The plan CONTENT authored here (NOT
routed through `odoo-planning`) is MODULE-FIRST (R2a - this is the whole-picture gate a flat commit
list cannot give): module topology (each module's own ordered commit list from the P0 map);
per-module EXTRACT tier (the real triaged tier, called out on its own line when it is opus - R2d
gate, `references/fp-triage-table.md` Table 1); per-commit bucket (the real classification) and
ADAPT tier within that module; installable routing per module; design-doc link for any commit P3
designed; merge batches.

Red flags: a text-gate "approve" is NOT Plan Mode approval (two separate steps); `EnterPlanMode`
MUST come before any branch, worktree, or file touch.

After Plan Mode approval, invoke the `git-toolkit:git-ops` skill (via the Skill tool) to create the
JOB-tier integration worktree branched FROM B (Hard rule 1 - no branch before this point). Describe the op:

```
op: create integration worktree
scope: branch fp/<slug>, base <target-branch>
worktree: <path>/fp-integration
```

THEN write `<ISOLATE_DIR>/forward-port/<slug>/plan.md` as the resume RECORD (not the gate - the gate
is Plan Mode above). MODULE-FIRST: one block per touched module, that module's commits nested
inside it in the module's own order (R2a - the whole-picture record). Later phases and the
checkpoint/continuation read it:

```markdown
# Forward-port plan: <source-series> -> <target-series> (<slug>)
Mode: continuous | one-shot
Absorption: <M> batch(es) -> <M> merge commit(s). Batch 1 = <src-first-SHA>..<src-tip-SHA> (<K> commits).
  (Default is ONE batch for the whole range. The commit count NEVER sets the merge count -
   SKILL.md Hard rule 2.)
Integration worktree: <path>  (branched from <target-branch>, B untouched)
Modules (<N>, after --scope/--since filter):

Outcome at target: (a) already in the target · (b) still needed, APIs compatible ·
(c) still needed, the old API is gone (re-implement) · (d) no longer relevant.

## Module: account_reports  (intent read at EXTRACT tier: sonnet)

| SHA | what it does | outcome at target | model that writes the port | ships on target? | design doc |
|-----|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------|------------------|------------|
| abc1234 | double-post guard | (b) APIs compatible | sonnet | yes | - |

## Module: report_engine_custom  (intent read at EXTRACT tier: opus - CONFIRMED at Plan Mode:
cross-module report engine rewrite)

| SHA | what it does | outcome at target | model that writes the port | ships on target? | design doc |
|-----|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------|------------------|------------|
| def5678 | new report engine | (c) old API gone - re-implement, do now | opus | yes | <SHARE_DIR>/designs/...md |

Deepest-reasoning rows (if any, ADAPT tier only - Table 1 has no fable band): <module>: <sha> -
<why> (about 2x the cost of the tier below). (confirmed in Plan Mode)
Opus-declined / gate-suppressed downgrades (if any, EXTRACT tier): <module>: sonnet (opus declined
| opus auto-downgraded - gate suppressed)
```

---

## P5 - Merge --no-commit (critical section) - ABSORB-ALL, runs ONCE per batch

Invoke the `git-toolkit:git-ops` skill (via the Skill tool) ONCE for the batch's ENTIRE commit
range. Dispatch contract: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/git-delegation.md`.
For semantic conflicts use the stateless-resume recipe in that snippet.

`<src-tip-SHA>` = the batch's LAST (newest) source commit after the `--since`/scope filter;
`<src-first-SHA>` = its first. Resolve both from the P0 range map before dispatching.

```
# continuous - one merge of the range TIP; every earlier SHA in the range comes with it
op: merge --no-ff --no-commit <src-tip-SHA>
worktree: <path>/fp-integration

# one-shot only (source frozen, or a deliberate sub-range) - the WHOLE range in one staged run
op: cherry-pick -n <src-first-SHA>^..<src-tip-SHA>
worktree: <path>/fp-integration
```

**Never iterate this phase per source commit, in either mode** (`SKILL.md` Hard rule 2): one merge
per commit mints N merge commits and re-resolves every shared hunk N times; one cherry-pick per
commit mints N fresh SHAs and re-resolves every conflict on every future run. A batch merges its
own range TIP once - the commit count never sets the merge count.

Only one merge in flight (shared git index). Do NOT commit - the working tree is the absorption
zone for the whole range through P9. Full protocol incl. absorption window order:
`[[fp-merge-absorption]]`.

---

## P6 - Symbol-survival check (MUST, before adapt)

**Dispatched, never run inline.** WHO may run this gate is the shared SSOT
`[[fp-symbol-survival-check]]` § Who runs this check; this phase only sequences the dispatches and
records what comes back. Do NOT run the conflict scan, the file enumeration, or the OSM grounding
in the orchestrating context.

1. Invoke the `git-toolkit:git-ops` skill (via the Skill tool) for the conflict-marker scan AND the
   `<merge-base>..<src-SHA>` file list in ONE dispatch (--name-only; git-ops writes both to a
   findings file, filtered to non-empty entries, and returns the path - those entries are the
   merge-clean-but-source-touched autosilent-break candidates). For cross-repo ports include
   `repo: <main-checkout-root>` (source commits live only in the main checkout after the P0
   source-remote add+fetch).
2. Dispatch `Explore` (read-only) over that returned file list to ground every Odoo symbol it
   references (field / method / model / view ref / external-id / manifest depend / ORM chain)
   against the TARGET version, per `[[fp-symbol-survival-check]]` sections 1-2.5. The OSM calls
   belong to that delegate; the orchestrator never issues them here.
3. Record only what the delegate returns: any absent/changed symbol FORCES bucket b/c/d and bans
   leaving the auto-merged line unchanged; the `SYMBOL-BROKEN | <symbol> | <file>:<line> | bucket |
   evidence` finding list (an empty list `SYMBOL-SURVIVAL: clean` is a valid, desirable result); and
   the PASS/FAIL verdict. A non-empty list BLOCKS P8 on those files. Full contract:
   `[[fp-symbol-survival-check]]`.

**Run on `tests/` files too** - test files auto-merge silently exactly like production code and
crash at collection (base-class kwarg drift, broken import, dynamic `ref()`), never reaching
P9 if collection itself fails. Do NOT re-derive the test-survival logic here - apply the
seven auto-merge-silent symbol classes from `[[fp-symbol-survival-check]]` section 2.5 (it already
states production AND `tests/` scope). The merge-clean-but-source-touched enumeration above
already lists test files; feed them through the same section-2.5 grounding, do not filter them
out.

---

## P7 - Pre-adapt drift scan (MUST, before the behavioral loop)

This gate is DISTINCT from the P6 TEST-survival sub-check:
- **P6 TEST-survival** uses `tests_covering` / `test_coverage_audit` (OSM cross-version
  symbol lookup) to detect test methods that REFERENCE a field/model removed at the target.
  It operates at the OSM symbol-graph level and covers both production and test code.
- **P7** uses the seven static symbol classes from `[[fp-symbol-survival-check]]` section 2.5
  over two lanes: (d) python-import + (e) AST-pyflakes + (g) ORM create/write dict-key run over
  ALL merged-touched `.py` (production AND `tests/`) - (d)(e) catch runtime NameError and (g)
  catches an Invalid-field key (autosilent: pyflakes does NOT flag it) before P9; the remaining
  classes (a)(b)(c)(f) and the collection ACCEPTANCE GATE apply to the `tests/` lane only.

The two checks are COMPLEMENTARY: P6 catches symbol-graph breaks via OSM; P7 catches
static grep / import / AST breaks and blocks entry to P8 when test collection itself would
fail.

**Enumerate scope - two lanes. Dispatched, never run inline** (`[[fp-symbol-survival-check]]`
§ Who runs this check):

Invoke the `git-toolkit:git-ops` skill (via the Skill tool) to list files changed in range `<merge-base>..<src-SHA>` (--name-only;
git-ops writes the file list). Include `repo: <main-checkout-root>` in the dispatch for
cross-repo ports. From the returned list the delegate derives:

- **Lane 1** - ALL merged-touched `.py` (production AND `tests/`): the `*.py` entries.
- **Lane 2** - `tests/` only: the Lane-1 entries whose path contains `tests/`.

Dispatch the gates as read-only delegates and record only their verdict. The delegate per class is
assigned once in `[[fp-symbol-survival-check]]` § Who runs this check - do not pick one here: the
git-ops dispatch above enumerates the files, and `Explore` runs every static lane below. Lane 1
gets classes (d) + (e) (`py_compile` + `pyflakes`) AND (g) (ORM create/write
dict-key scan) over ALL .py - production AND tests; Lane 2 additionally gets (a) (b) (c) (f). Treat
F821 on a production file as a runtime NameError that would crash module load, not a nit; treat a
(g) dead key on a production call site the same way - it raises `Invalid field` at load/run yet
pyflakes stays silent.

Record findings as `SYMBOL-BROKEN | <symbol/path> | <file>:<line> | <class> | evidence` and
append to `merge-log.md`. These become the `BROKEN TEST-SYMBOLS` input to the 8a brief.

**ACCEPTANCE GATE (collection clean) - mandatory before P8 starts:**

At P7 no instance DB has been acquired yet (allocator runs at P9), so the gate is a
`pytest --collect-only` run over the merged test files - it needs no DB and catches ImportError /
missing-fixture breaks for ordinary test modules. Dispatch it to `Explore` (read-only), the delegate
`[[fp-symbol-survival-check]]` § Who runs this check assigns to this class. Brief it with: the
integration worktree path, the merged test file list Lane 2 produced, the exact command
`python -m pytest --collect-only <those files>`, and the instruction to return ONLY `PASS`, or
`FAIL` plus one line per collection error (`<file>::<node> | <error class> | <message>`) - never the
raw log. Record that verdict; never run the command, or read its log, in the orchestrating context.

**No ad hoc provisioning, in any phase** (SKILL.md P9's DELEGATE mandate is not scoped to P9 alone;
a bare provisioning call from ANY non-leaf phase in this pipeline bypasses the SAME instance HARD
RULES regardless of which phase issues it). When a `setUpClass` performs DB-dependent work that
`--collect-only` cannot exercise (a TestCase subclass that touches the ORM during class setup), do
NOT acquire an ad hoc DB here to work around it - the ONLY provisioning path this pipeline uses is
P9's `odoo-instance` dispatch (`## P9` below). Record the residual (a `setUpClass`
`--collect-only` cannot verify) as an open ACCEPTANCE GATE item on that test file's `merge-log.md`
row, and treat P9's own collection/run-tests result for that file as the gate's true confirmation
once the P9 instance exists. The `pytest --collect-only` verdict above is still mandatory and still
blocks P8 for every OTHER file it covers.

Memory-cap policy (applies at P9's instance dispatch, not here):
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/odoo-bin-resource-limits.md`.

A collection failure (ImportError, setUpClass crash, missing fixture) means the tests NEVER
RAN in P9 - a count of `0 failed, N error(s)` is NOT a passing result (the setUpClass
crashed before any test method ran). Resolve every drift finding (P7 SYMBOL-BROKEN entries)
before entering the P8 adapt loop.

**View-topology sub-check (bucket-(b)/(c) same-module inherit stacks).** Different in TIMING from
the checks above (P6/P7 run over the git-merged tree before any commit is re-implemented; this
sub-check runs once a bucket-(b) OR bucket-(c) commit's own adapt step lands or modifies an
`ir.ui.view` record - the bucket-(c) re-implement leg, or the bucket-(b) 3-way-merge-and-adapt leg
INCLUDING a clean auto-merge that passed through with no conflict marker at all (e.g. an
alias-preserving module fold at target that leaves the old base `xml_id` still resolving, so P6
finds nothing broken and P2 classifies bucket-(b) instead of (c) even though the resulting view
shape is identical to the canonical bucket-(c) defect) - at the same 8a/8b converge-back point
those legs already pass through) but IDENTICAL in SHAPE
(a finding line triaged into `merge-log.md`, confirmed before the gate). Buckets (a)/(d) land no
new adapt content (Hard rule 7) and stay out of scope - only (b) and (c) can produce this shape.
A HIT is a PROPOSAL only: the merge-and-delete outcome routes out through the P3 design gate to
`odoo-solution-design` and is applied solely when the returned `design_doc` adopts it.
Full predicate, the two
non-defect exceptions, and the merge-unsafe escape: `references/fp-triage-table.md` § Bucket-(c)
same-module inherit-view check.

## P8 - Adapt (test-first; serial per-module; ALWAYS directly in the integration worktree)

P5 already absorbed the batch's whole range into the working tree, so P8 adapts the MERGED RESULT
module by module, driven by the per-commit intent records - it never re-opens, re-merges, or
re-stages anything per source commit. For each touched module/WI, dispatch the adapt unit DIRECTLY
in the integration worktree
(`<path>/fp-integration`, the JOB-tier worktree already created at P4 - `## P4` above) and process
modules serially - complete one module before starting the next. A module whose files were touched
by several commits in the range is adapted ONCE, against the combined merged result. P8 NEVER
creates a per-module child worktree (full derivation: `SKILL.md` § Git topology "WORK tier - NOT
used by P8 adapt"): P8 is serial (no concurrent writer to filesystem-isolate) AND the open-merge
window below never clears before P8 runs (no committed tip for a child to fork from, and no way to
converge one back in time even if created).

**Open-merge window (CRITICAL constraint - unconditional, not a special case).** For the ENTIRE
span from P5 (`--no-commit`) through P10 (`commit`) - i.e. the batch's whole P6/P7/P8/P9 -
`MERGE_HEAD` (continuous mode) or `CHERRY_PICK_HEAD` (one-shot mode) is live in the
integration worktree. Git rejects any second merge in that worktree until the first is committed
or aborted (error: `MERGE_HEAD exists`), so a child worktree could never converge back during P8,
in EITHER mode. There is no per-commit gap to exploit, because absorb-all is the ONLY shape both
modes use: ONE window per batch, opened by P5 and closed only by P10, never a per-commit window
opened and closed inside the batch (`SKILL.md` Hard rule 2 bans that outright). Adapt all modules
SERIALLY, DIRECTLY in the integration worktree, in either mode - continuous keeps `MERGE_HEAD` live
for the batch's whole P6-P9 span, one-shot keeps `CHERRY_PICK_HEAD` live for exactly the same span.
SSOT: `[[fp-merge-absorption]]` §Absorption-window.

**8a - forward the test FIRST** (the test is the oracle; independence keeps it honest).
**R2b - at most one `odoo-test-writer` instance per module across the WHOLE run:** on the module's
FIRST commit in this run, launch a NEW `odoo-test-writer` agent in adapt mode (it authors by
invoking the `odoo-test-writing` skill inline, in its own context) and record the id that launch
returns in `plan.md` keyed by module; on
any LATER commit touching the SAME module, RESUME that recorded id
(CHP Tier-A) instead of launching a new one - full rule and the cd-on-resume requirement:
`SKILL.md` § P8. The brief below is identical on a fresh launch or a resume; only the SOURCE TEST
content and the per-commit fields (INTENT/BUCKET/BROKEN TEST-SYMBOLS) change per commit - the
Worktree path field never changes (P8 always adapts directly in the SAME integration worktree for
the whole run, `SKILL.md` § Git topology).

```
TEST ADAPT MODE: forward this source test to the target platform.
SOURCE TEST (READ/WRITE, in the integration worktree): <path>/fp-integration/<module>/tests/<test_file>
  (merged working-tree content; for bucket (b) it may still carry conflict markers or auto-merged
   text - resolve IN PLACE and write the adapted result back to this SAME path. P8 never uses a
   separate child worktree, so there is no WRITE-TO location distinct from where this is read.)
WORKTREE_PATH: <path>/fp-integration   (the integration worktree named above - the ONE root this
      dispatch works in)
SHARE_DIR: <the run's captured absolute SHARE path - substitute it, never re-resolve>
ISOLATE_DIR: <the run's captured absolute ISOLATE path - substitute it, never re-resolve;
      `<ISOLATE_DIR>` keys on the enclosing repository root, so an author that resolves it from
      inside fp-integration writes the run's worklog into that worktree's own tree>
INTENT: <one-liner from THIS module's own <module>/intents/<sha>.md, written by that module's P1
      extractor - § P1 write path>   BUCKET: <a|b|c|d>
ODOO VERSION: <target>
BASE CLASS (target): <signature from test_base_classes(odoo_version='<target>') for the source
      test's base class - the kwargs the target setUpClass/setUp actually accepts, so the author
      does not re-introduce a dropped kwarg>
TARGET TEST EXAMPLES: <1-2 paths from find_test_examples(query='<feature>', odoo_version='<target>')
      that already test this behavior the target-idiomatic way - imitate their structure>
BROKEN TEST-SYMBOLS: <the P6 / P7 SYMBOL-BROKEN entries that land in THIS test file - the
      author must repair each (do not forward them verbatim)>
RULE: translate to target API; STRIP implementation-coupled assertions (private method asserts,
      call counts, internal ordering); re-create the BEHAVIOR on target; confirm RED on target.
      Never relax/rewrite an assertion to pass unless the target platform legitimately redefines
      the behavior AND you cite the OSM/platform reason.
```

Resolve the three enrichment lines BEFORE dispatch:

```python
test_base_classes(odoo_version='18.0')                                      # BASE CLASS (target)
find_test_examples(query='double-post guard on account.move', odoo_version='18.0')  # TARGET TEST EXAMPLES
```

`BROKEN TEST-SYMBOLS` is the subset of the P6 symbol-survival finding list (plus any P7 drift
finding) whose `<file>` is this test file - copy those rows in verbatim; omit the line when the
list is empty for this file.

**8b - adapt the code** per bucket. Invoke the `odoo-coding` skill (via the Skill tool) with the
FP-ENRICHED brief - `odoo-coding` owns the backend/frontend split, coder fan-out (via its
`odoo-coder` per-node coordinator), model, and synthesis (do NOT dispatch raw `odoo-coder`,
`odoo-backend-coder`, or `odoo-frontend-coder`). **R2b at this leg is CLOSED: launch the
coordinator once, record the id, resume it across commits - the SAME field shape as 8a, an id your
own launch returned.**
`agents/odoo-coder.md` § Cross-round resume confirms the coordinator is round-scoped, not
single-shot-forever - a caller may resume the SAME coordinator for a LATER commit instead of
cold-spawning a fresh one, the same mechanism already used for the 8a `odoo-test-writer` above.
On the module's FIRST commit omit the field and record the coordinator id `odoo-coding` reports back
for that module in `plan.md`; on every LATER commit touching the same module, carry that recorded
value as `WORKER_AGENT_ID: <id>` in the brief below - the SAME field label and shape the 8a leg
uses, never a second differently-shaped field, and never a string anyone invented.
**R2b IS closed at 8b: `odoo-coding`'s brief-consumption contract
recognizes `WORKER_AGENT_ID` and resumes that id instead of
cold-spawning a fresh coordinator** (full reasoning:
`SKILL.md` § P8). Hard rule 2 is unaffected either way: resuming the AGENT is a context-economy
decision with NO effect on git topology - the batch's whole range is already absorbed by P5's
single merge before any coder runs, so N commits' worth of adapt work lands inside that ONE open
window and closes as ONE merge commit. The extra
context a generic
coder brief lacks:

```
DISPATCH MODEL: <adapt-tier>
REQUEST: Adapt the forwarded intent to the target platform.
INTENT RECORD: <ISOLATE_DIR>/forward-port/<slug>/<module>/intents/<sha>.md   (THIS module's own
      perspective on the sha, written by its P1 extractor per § P1 write path - the why, build to
      this, not the source diff)
BUCKET: <a skip-code | b 3-way+adapt | c re-implement on target idiom | d skip-code>
FAILING TEST (RED, written by the odoo-test-writer above): <paths> - implement until GREEN; do NOT edit them.
NEW MODULE: <yes - apply installable:False checklist [[fp-installable-false]] | no>
DESIGN_DOC: <path from plan.md's design_doc column for this commit | none>   (P3's route-out
      result, `references/fp-phase-detail.md` P3 - so 8b never adapts blind; `none` when P3 never
      routed this commit to design; same sentinel shape `odoo-coding`'s own resolution already
      uses, `skills/odoo-coding/SKILL.md` "DESIGN_DOC: <child TDD path | none>")
MODULE SCOPE: <name>
  READ/WRITE (in the integration worktree, no separate child worktree): <path>/fp-integration/<module>/
    (merged content; for bucket (b) 3-way+adapt start from these files - they hold the
     auto-merged or conflict-marked state - and write ALL output back here, in place)
ODOO VERSION: <target>
WORKTREE_PATH: <path>/fp-integration   (the integration worktree named in MODULE SCOPE - the ONE
  root this dispatch works in)
SHARE_DIR: <the run's captured absolute SHARE path - substitute it, never re-resolve>
ISOLATE_DIR: <the run's captured absolute ISOLATE path - the SAME literal INTENT RECORD above was
  built from; substitute it, never re-resolve from a worktree cwd>
WORKLOG: <slug> - read, then append.
MANIFEST/MIGRATION/PROVENANCE: apply C1 (keep TARGET version on conflict, never bump), C2 (migration-dir
  retarget), C3 (carry pre-existing source bugs faithfully, do not inline-fix) - [[fp-merge-absorption]]
WORKER_AGENT_ID: <id recorded for this module on its first dispatch this run>   (omit on the
      module's FIRST commit - see above)
USER LANGUAGE: <lang | omit when English>
```

**8c - installable:False modules** - two sub-cases, same manifest action. (i) **New module** (absent
at target): `installable: False`, comment `auto_install`/`application`, lint-fix only.
(ii) **Upgraded-then-forwarded** (target clean-tip = `installable:False` but merge carries `True`):
re-set to False + re-comment `auto_install`/`application` with `# TODO: Uncomment when upgrading
module to production-ready status` breadcrumb - then lint-fix only. SSOT: `[[fp-installable-false]]`.

**8c-bis - installable:False at target = LINT-ONLY lane.** BEFORE dispatching the coder/reviewer
for any module (new or pre-existing), confirm its target installable flag. Re-read
`<module>/<tgt-descriptor>` at `target_ref` (via git-ops, read-only) only if the manifest was touched
by the merge; otherwise reuse the value P2 already resolved from `manifest_path`. If
`installable: False` at the target, brief
the coder in **lint-only mode**: run flake8 / eslint / prettier / ruff and fix ONLY syntax/lint
breakage to keep CI green - do NOT adapt business logic, do NOT upgrade content. Pass
`LINT-ONLY: yes` in the 8b brief and the pointer `[[fp-installable-false]]`. The single exception
to "no logic change" is a syntax/lint error that itself blocks the file from parsing.
When the merged `<tgt-descriptor>` now shows `installable:True` (upgrade-commit carried in)
but the target clean-tip was `installable:False`, re-set to False + re-comment
`auto_install`/`application` with the `# TODO: Uncomment when upgrading` breadcrumb before
dispatching the coder. SSOT: `[[fp-installable-false]]`.

**8d - migration script:** RETARGET a forwarded `migrations/<src-series>.a.b.c/` dir per C2:
default = rename to FULL `<tgt-series>.V` where `V` is chosen so the dir fires on a deployed target
DB at manifest `M` (if `S > M`: `V=S`, merge already bumped; if `S <= M`: bump manifest to
`V = M`'s last component +1, name dir `<tgt-series>.V`). Exception: a legacy source-origin-only
data fix keeps `<src-series>.a.b.c` untouched. Lint-only lane (`installable:False` at target) = do
NOT retarget. This is a migration-threshold action, NOT a "diff-touched-a-file" bump (C1). Full
rule + `adapt_version` silent-skip WHY: `[[fp-merge-absorption]]`. After the rename, sweep the
migration body for source-series literals still in log strings or version constants:

```bash
grep -rn '<src-series>' migrations/<tgt-series>/   # e.g. grep -rn '17\.0' migrations/18.0/
```

**8e - i18n: COMPUTE and RECORD; the dispatch happens at P9.5.** Do NOT dispatch `odoo-i18n` here -
this phase has no instance, and `odoo-i18n` hard-BLOCKs without one. Evaluate both mandate conditions
now, from artifacts that already exist, and record them on the module's `merge-log.md` row:

1. **Condition 1 - translatable delta.** Run the 8-signal trigger table over this batch's
   `<ISOLATE_DIR>/forward-port/<slug>/commits/<sha>.dump` files. Record
   `i18n_signals: [<fired ids>]` or `i18n_signals: none`.
2. **Condition 2 - already live at the target.** Read `installable_false` from this module's
   `merge-log.md` row. Record `i18n_due: yes|no|escape:<E-id>`.

Both conditions and the escape table: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/i18n-mandate-contract.md`.
Carry `i18n_due` forward to P9.5. Recording it here and dispatching there is deliberate: the decision
needs the diff (available now), the dispatch needs the instance (available at P9).

No convergence or worktree removal step here: 8a/8b already wrote directly into the integration
worktree (no per-module child worktree exists to converge back or remove - `SKILL.md` § Git
topology). Mark `status=adapted`.

---

## P9 - Verify by behavior (PER-BATCH, in integration)

Resolve odoo-bin flags for the TARGET series via `cli_help` before dispatching - the allocator
returns version-agnostic ports; flags and bootstrap behavior differ per series (e.g. v19
namespace package changes bootstrap; always pass `odoo_version=<target>` to `cli_help`).

Instance lifecycle protocol: `docs/reference/INSTANCE-LIFECYCLE-BUILD-CONTRACT.md`. Test invocation
conventions: `docs/reference/ODOO-TESTING.md`.

**DELEGATE - never a raw `allocator.py`/`odoo-bin` recipe.** SKILL.md P9's rule is binding here
too: this orchestrator dispatches the `odoo-instance` skill (via the Skill tool) for every step
below. Only `odoo-instance-ops` and the instance-touching HARD LEAVES enumerated in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/instance-handle-contract.md` may call `scripts/lib/allocator.py`
or `odoo-bin` directly (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/worker-brief.md` § Carve-out) - a bare
allocator/odoo-bin call from this orchestration layer would both bypass the instance HARD RULES
and skip the `WORKTREE_PATH` re-root below. Everything from here to the P10 gate is CONTENT for
that dispatch brief and the adjudication this orchestrator performs on the RETURNED `instance-ops`
block, never a shell recipe run inline.

**Env-bootstrap (informational, before the first dispatch).** Resolve the CATALOG
(principal-checkout) baseline from the declared `[[instance]]` entry covering this repo -
`INST_ADDONS_PATH` and `INST_PYTHON` per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/project-facts-resolution.md` rung 2. That is a baseline only:
venv/interpreter discovery and addons-path assembly are `odoo-instance-ops`'s
own job (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/odoo-instance/SKILL.md`), never hand-built or hand-verified
here. A multi-repo stack (e.g. Viindoo Standard spans 4 repos) needs EVERY repo on disk - a missing
repo makes a module invisible (silent ImportError / "module not found") to the dispatched instance.
Confirm every root in that entry's `addons_path` list exists on disk before dispatching; a missing
repo is `BLOCKED` (NEEDS_CONTEXT), not a test red.

**Worktree re-root (MANDATORY, after the CATALOG baseline above, before it is treated as final).**
The block above resolves the CATALOG (principal-checkout) baseline only - it is NEVER the addons_path
this phase actually verifies against. This batch adapted `<path>/fp-integration` (the P4 JOB-tier
integration worktree), so re-root the baseline onto it via the SAME mechanism every other consumer
uses - `odoo-instance`'s `WORKTREE_PATH` field (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/odoo-instance/SKILL.md`
§ WORKTREE_PATH substitution) plus the allocator's `--addons-path-override`: dispatch `odoo-instance`
(SKILL.md P9) with `WORKTREE_PATH: <path>/fp-integration`, which drops every catalog entry under the
principal checkout and prepends the equivalent under `<path>/fp-integration` before `acquire`. Do NOT
hand-build the override yourself and do NOT verify against the catalog `ADDONS_PATH` built above
directly - that is exactly the un-adapted-code false-green this re-root exists to prevent. Before trusting any
result below, assert the resolved addons list contains `<path>/fp-integration/<module>/<tgt-descriptor>`
for every module in this batch (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/instance-handle-contract.md` §
Addons coverage assertion) - on a miss, `BLOCKED`, never a silent run against the wrong tree.

**Install/verify the FULL transitive `depends` closure, not just the module you edited.**
A forwarded change can break a downstream depender that you never touched. Resolve the closure
per module, then install/verify its breadth:

```python
module_inspect(name='account_accountant', method='dependencies', odoo_version='18.0')
```

Union the closures of every directly-touched module and pass that whole set as `modules` in the
dispatch below.

**Lint toolchain present BEFORE the lint gate.** The verify venv must have flake8 / ruff
(and eslint / prettier for frontend) installed, or the P12 lint gate silently no-ops. Confirm
`flake8 --version` and `ruff --version` resolve in the verify env before relying on a green lint.

**Dispatch `odoo-instance` (via the Skill tool) - ONE ephemeral instance per BATCH, not per
commit.** First commit in the batch (fresh DB; install + test in one pass - Odoo create-on-init
builds the DB, the allocator only reserves the name/ports):

```
operation: run-tests
series: <target>
persist: ephemeral
RUN_ID: <this run's id>
SHARE_DIR: <the run's captured absolute SHARE path - substitute it, never re-resolve>
ISOLATE_DIR: <the run's captured absolute ISOLATE path - substitute it, never re-resolve>
WORKTREE_PATH: <path>/fp-integration   # re-root per the Worktree re-root note above
modules: <union of the touched modules' full transitive depends closure, comma-separated>
test_tags: <`/<m>` for every module in that closure, comma-joined - the closure's own suites run,
            the Odoo core it dragged in does not. See the narrowing rule below>
mode: fresh
skip_auto_install: true   # ISOLATES auto_install modules that would otherwise be pulled in
                          # silently and mask (or fabricate) a break
CONFIRM: "confirm each module in this closure emits a Loading line before reading any test count -
          Odoo silent-skips an installable:False or skip_auto_install-excluded module with NO
          error line, so a green run alone is not proof it installed; report per-module install
          status in modules_installed and the test result in findings_path"
```

Capture the returned `instance-ops` block as this batch's `INSTANCE_HANDLE` (`db_name`,
`lease_token`, `run_id`, `addons_path`) - memory-cap is applied automatically inside
`odoo-instance-ops`, no separate field to pass
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/odoo-bin-resource-limits.md`). **Pass `test_tags` - the install
closure and the tag set are two sides of one scope** (SSOT:
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/test-scope-contract.md`). Default: `/<m>` for every module in the
INSTALL CLOSURE this batch named, comma-joined - the whole closure's suites run, and the Odoo core
that the closure dragged in does not. NEVER narrow below that to only the edited module: a forwarded
change can break tests in a downstream depender, and a module-only tag would hide that. Record the
tag set used in `merge-log.md`.

For a SUBSEQUENT commit in the SAME batch touching only a subset, re-dispatch `odoo-instance` with
the SAME `INSTANCE_HANDLE` forwarded and `mode: reuse` (`-u` semantics) on the changed modules only
- skip re-running the full closure. Behavior rule: once a module is installed in this DB,
re-running its tests MUST use `reuse`; `fresh`/`-i` on an already-installed module is a no-op
(confirm flags via `cli_help`). Full rule: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/reference/ODOO-TESTING.md`.

Relay the returned `instance-ops` block (`log_path`, `findings_path`, `modules_installed`,
`failed`/`errors`/`warnings`/`skipped`) into `merge-log.md` verbatim - never trust a bare "tests
passed" summary in its place (Hard rule 8: verify the result yourself). Reconcile
`modules_installed` against the installable scan (`[[fp-symbol-survival-check]]` section 2.5f): a
module that is `installable: False` at the target is EXPECTED to be absent from
`modules_installed` - route it to the 8c-bis lint-only lane and do NOT count its absence as a
break. A module that IS installable and absent from `modules_installed` is a real failure -
investigate via `log_path` before reading any test count.

**Recover a batch stuck mid-run.** Do NOT `pkill` an `odoo-bin` process or call
`allocator.py release` directly. Dispatch `odoo-instance` with `operation: drop`, passing the
batch's cached `lease_token`/`run_id` - it stops the bound process group FIRST, then drops the DB
through Odoo (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/odoo-instance-ops.md` § drop-instance); a bare `pkill`
risks matching the wrong process or a sibling batch's server. Re-dispatch the Step above for a
clean retry.

- **RED-then-GREEN (whole module):** target suite must be green.
- **Confirm-by-toggle (FP-delta tests only):** disable each newly-forwarded adapt -> that test
  must go RED -> restore. Proves the test exercises the adapted behavior. Do NOT toggle the whole
  suite.
- **Triage red:** Triage EVERY red against a clean-tip baseline before calling it a
  regression - whether the red is in the edited module or in a co-installed dependency pulled
  in by the closure. Re-dispatch `odoo-instance` (same shape as above) against a clean checkout of
  the target tip - no `WORKTREE_PATH` override, no absorption - running the SAME closure. Red
  there too = pre-existing (record in merge-log.md, do not fix, do not block). Green on clean /
  red only after absorption = FP-delta (fix before committing). A red in a co-installed dep you
  never touched is almost always pre-existing - prove it with the clean-tip dispatch, do not
  assume. Never widen an assertion to hide a pre-existing failure. For source-series
  follow-through on a pre-existing red, apply C3 - carry faithfully + open a source issue
  (resolvable remote) or record it; see `[[fp-merge-absorption]]` § Triage / C3.
- **Baseline a failed INSTALL the same way.** If a module fails to install, re-dispatch
  `odoo-instance` against clean `origin/<target-branch>` (no `WORKTREE_PATH`, no absorption).
  Fails there too = a PRE-EXISTING break in the target series, NOT FP-introduced - record it in
  `merge-log.md` and do NOT block the forward-port on it. Only an install that is green on clean
  origin/target and red after absorption is an FP-delta to fix.
- **CREATEDB role:** an `ephemeral` acquire refuses (exit 6, 7, 8 or 9) instead of borrowing the
  declared DB, so batches are never silently serialised onto one database; on any of them follow
  `[[fp-merge-absorption]]` § Ephemeral isolation.

Full per-batch protocol: `[[fp-merge-absorption]]`. Mark `status=verified`.

---

## P10 - Gate merge (STOP, per batch) - ONE commit closes the whole range

Present `merge-log.md` and wait for human-confirm. On confirm, invoke the `git-toolkit:git-ops` skill (via the Skill tool) ONCE:

```
op: commit
message: |
  fp: absorb <src-first-SHA>..<src-tip-SHA> - <one-line summary>

  <sha> <bucket x> <one-line reason>      # one body line per absorbed commit
  ...
worktree: <path>/fp-integration
confirmed: yes - human approved at P10 gate
```

That single commit closes the batch's merge window and lands the whole range; every SHA in the
range is marked `done` in `checkpoint.json` by it. Buckets (a)/(d) are absorbed by the same commit
and carry no diff (Hard rule 7) - their body line records the bucket + reason so the empty
contribution is not flagged.

**There is no P5 loop.** A single-batch run (the default) reaches P10 once, then goes on to P11.
Only a human-approved multi-batch split at the P4 plan gate returns to P5, once PER BATCH, never
per commit: that pass merges the NEXT batch's range TIP in ONE operation, then P6 symbol-survival
-> P7 drift -> P8 adapt -> P9 verify -> P10 gate for that whole batch. Re-entering P5 for a single
source commit, or committing part-way through a batch's range, is `SKILL.md` Hard rule 2's banned
shape. Never skip P5/P6/P7 for a later batch by jumping straight to P8 either - that would leave
the next range unabsorbed and unchecked.

---

## P12 - PR + review

Runs AFTER P11 (end-to-end acceptance, `SKILL.md` § P11) has already cleared for this batch -
acceptance, then this review gate, THEN the PR opens; never the reverse (`SKILL.md` Hard rule 9;
SSOT for the ordering rationale: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/run-harness/references/run-integration.md`
§ Pre-PR tail).

Invoke the `git-toolkit:git-ops` skill (via the Skill tool) to push (resolve origin URL via `git remote get-url origin`):

```
op: push fp/<slug> to origin (NOT B)
scope: branch fp/<slug>
worktree: <path>/fp-integration
remote: resolve via `git remote get-url origin`
```

Run `odoo-code-review` inline (via the Skill tool, from the orchestrating context) for the
forward-port pitfall (a forwarded test still coupled to the source API) - this review runs on the
pushed branch BEFORE the PR is created (the diff-based checks below need only the push above, not
an open PR).

**Attribute every finding to the FP diff before rating it.** A reviewer rating the whole
file blames the forward-port for code it never touched. Before rating any finding, confirm the
line is actually in the forward-port delta. Invoke the `git-toolkit:git-ops` skill (via the Skill tool) for a three-dot diff
(`origin/<target-branch>...fp/<slug> -- <file>`, only what the FP added to `<file>`).

A finding on a line NOT in this diff is pre-existing - note it separately, do not block the PR on
it (flag it, do not gate the forward-port on it).

**Per finding, apply C3 (fix old version first).** Check whether the same defect exists at the source
series. If it does, it is a **pre-existing source bug** (inherited - forwarded faithfully, not introduced
by this port): route the fix UPSTREAM via a source-series issue (invoke git-ops when a source
remote resolves via `git remote get-url`, else record it in `merge-log.md` + the Continuation Contract);
do NOT patch it inside the FP. Record `<sha> | C3 | source issue <ref|DEFERRED> | <evidence>` in
`merge-log.md` and carry it faithfully forward. EXCEPTION: a serious security/safety bug is fixed on the
destination immediately (still open a source issue). SSOT: `[[fp-merge-absorption]]` § Triage / C3.

**Narrow a field-existence question with a direct lookup, not a model_inspect retry.** When
a finding hinges on whether one field still exists / changed type at the target, query that field
directly instead of re-dumping the whole model:

```python
entity_lookup(kind='field', model='account.move', field='payment_state', odoo_version='18.0')
```

**installable:False modules get a LINT-ONLY review.** For any module that is
`installable: False` at the target (8c-bis lane), the reviewer rates ONLY syntax / lint findings -
do NOT raise business-logic / behavior findings against a module that does not even install at the
target. Mark such findings out-of-scope for this forward-port.

Only once the review above is addressed, invoke the `git-toolkit:git-ops` skill (via the Skill
tool) to create the PR:

```
op: create PR
base: <target-branch>
head: fp/<slug>
title: "..."
body: "..."
remote: resolve from `git remote get-url origin`
```

**Cross-check every static-review bot comment on the PR (post-PR, the ONE sub-step here that
genuinely needs an open PR).** Once the PR above is open and CI has had a chance to run, read the
bot (CI linter / review bot) comments and resolve or consciously waive each - a bot comment on a
forward-ported line is signal that an auto-merged construct did not survive the target. This runs
after PR creation, never before, and never gates PR creation itself.

NEVER squash (squash mints a new SHA, defeats merge-base advance). B stays LOCKED - the PR adds
only the merge commits. Present the PR URL, the review findings, and the P11 acceptance verdict
together, and wait for the human to merge.

## Cleanup (after human merge)

Invoke the `git-toolkit:git-ops` skill (via the Skill tool) to remove the integration worktree and delete the integration branch.

```bash
# Invoke git-ops:
#   op: worktree remove <path>/fp-integration
#   confirmed: yes - forward-port is merged
git worktree list          # confirm no dangling fp/<slug>-* child worktrees
# Invoke git-ops:
#   op: branch delete fp/<slug>
#   confirmed: yes - forward-port is merged
```

Leave `<ISOLATE_DIR>/forward-port/<slug>/` for the next continuous run's resume (it is gitignored and
the checkpoint lets tomorrow's run skip done commits).
