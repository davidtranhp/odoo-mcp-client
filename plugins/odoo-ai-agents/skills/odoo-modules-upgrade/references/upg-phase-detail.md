# upg-phase-detail - per-phase commands + dispatch briefs

SSOT for verbatim git commands, subagent dispatch briefs, and artifact formats for the
`odoo-modules-upgrade` skill. The SKILL.md body states WHAT each phase achieves; this
file specifies HOW. Cross-references reused skills' SSOTs; copies none.

---

## Symbols (resolve once, reuse everywhere)

- `<cluster>` = `cluster_slug` resolved in P0 intake (the scope slug).
- `<path>` = the upgrade-worktree base: a `.upg-worktrees/` directory SIBLING to the principal
  checkout (NEVER inside it - keeps the principal `git status` clean). All worktrees below live under it.
- `<work-base>` = the base ref the integration branch forks from, resolved per
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/git-delegation.md` § Base-branch resolution - never inferred
  from the invoking checkout's current branch.

## Artifact paths

Base: `<ISOLATE_DIR>/modules-upgrade/<src>-<tgt>-<cluster>/` (resolve `<SHARE_DIR>`/`<ISOLATE_DIR>`
once per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/state-root-resolution.md`; substitute the captured
absolute path - never write the placeholder or a bare `.odoo-ai/` into a Read/Write/Edit)
Integration worktree: `<path>/upg-integration` (JOB tier, created at P4 post-gate)
Child worktrees: `<path>/upg-<module>` per module (WORK tier, created + removed in P4)
Progress ledger: `<ISOLATE_DIR>/modules-upgrade/<src>-<tgt>-<cluster>/checkpoint.json`
  Schema: `{"<module>": "pending|absorbed|designed|adapted|reviewed|installed|done"}`
  Written after each module completes a phase. Per-phase skip rules on resume:
  P2 skips {absorbed, designed, adapted, reviewed, installed, done};
  P4 skips {adapted, reviewed, installed, done};
  P4b skips {reviewed, installed, done};
  P5 skips {installed, done} at the dependency-level granularity.

## P0 - Intake subagent dispatch brief

Model: sonnet. Read-only. Output file: `intake.md`.

```
TASK: Resolve the upgrade request into structured inputs.

(1) Read the current branch name (`git branch --show-current`). Infer the Odoo SERIES
    from it: a branch named `17.0`, `17.0-feat-x`, or `viindoo-17.0` -> series `17.0`.
    If the branch name is ambiguous, mark as open_question.
    Cross-check: read a sample of module descriptors (BOTH names, as in (3a)) and find the MAX `version` series
    present on disk. If the branch-inferred series and the manifest-max series disagree
    (e.g. branch says `17.0` but manifests say `16.0.x.y.z`), raise as open_question
    rather than silently trusting the branch name.
    EXCEPTION - the manifests carry a SHORT `version` (2-3 numeric parts, no series prefix; the
    normal form, see `references/upg-classification-table.md` § Manifest breaks): there is no series
    in the manifest to compare, so SKIP the branch-vs-manifest-series cross-check entirely and
    resolve the source series from branch + profile. Do NOT raise a false "disagree" open_question.
    The exception is keyed on the VALUE's form, never on which distribution the module belongs to.
    This current-branch read is ONLY for inferring the SOURCE series being upgraded FROM; it is
    NEVER used to resolve `<work-base>` - see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/git-delegation.md`
    § Base-branch resolution for that.

(2) Map that series to the OSM profile:
    - set_active_version(odoo_version='<inferred_series>')
    - list_available_profiles()
    - For each profile that looks relevant (name contains the series or is the default),
      profile_inspect(name='<profile>', method='summary', odoo_version='<inferred_series>') to confirm repos + module set.
    Report the matched_profile and its repos.

(3) Auto-detect CANDIDATE MODULES using a manifest-version-series scan:
    a. Find all module descriptors - glob BOTH names, or a v8-v9 source cluster is invisible:
       find . \( -name "__manifest__.py" -o -name "__openerp__.py" \) 2>/dev/null
    b. For each manifest, extract the `version` field. A module is a CANDIDATE if its
       manifest `version` major series is LESS THAN the target series
       (e.g. version `16.0.1.2.3` when target is `17.0`).
    c. Also include any module that depends on a stale-versioned candidate (depends-on-stale
       scan: read each manifest's `depends` list and include modules whose direct dep is
       already in the candidate set).
    d. `installable: False` is a WEAK HINT only - log it alongside the candidate but do
       NOT use it as the primary detector. A module can be `installable: True` and still
       be a valid upgrade target; a `installable: False` module that is a helper/dev/demo
       module may NOT be an upgrade target.
    e. SHORT-FORM blind spot - a property of the VALUE, not of the distribution. Step (b) keys on a
       series prefix, so ANY manifest carrying the short form (`1.0.0`) yields NOTHING from it, on
       every profile. The short form is the normal form, so expect (b) to be silent and NEVER read
       that silence as "no candidates". Whenever (b) returns nothing, detect candidates by PROFILE
       MEMBERSHIP (`profile_inspect` module set) intersected with branch series + repo path instead;
       candidacy_reason = `profile-membership`.
    Emit the candidate list with paths and the reason for candidacy (version-series|depends-on-stale|profile-membership|installable-hint).

(4) Determine:
    - source_version: from the matched profile's Odoo version or the manifest `version`
      field (e.g. `16.0.1.0.0` -> series `16.0`).
    - target_version: from the NL ask ("upgrade to v17" -> `17.0`; "next major" -> the
      major after source_version). If not determinable, mark as open_question.

(5) Dependency hints: for each candidate module, read its descriptor's `depends`
    field and emit {module: [dep1, dep2, ...]} pairs.

(6) If the user's MODULE SCOPE is not explicit in the NL ask, do NOT guess. Return
    candidate_modules + proposed_cluster (seeded from the dependency closure of the
    confirmed candidate modules - read each candidate's `depends` recursively to include
    all in-repo transitive deps; do NOT use naming/path proximity as the primary
    scoping heuristic) + an open_question asking the user to confirm or narrow.

OUTPUT FORMAT (write to intake.md):
```yaml
resolved_series: "17.0"
matched_profile: "viindoo_standard_17"
cluster_slug: "l10n_vn"   # scope slug; becomes <cluster> in every artifact path + worktree/branch name

## P1 - Recon parallel dispatch

Four dispatches fire simultaneously (Mode B concurrency, independent): P1a DAG, P1b deprecation
audit, P1c version delta, P1d transitive symbol survey.

### P1a - DAG build (Explore, sonnet)

```
TASK: Emit the dependency graph for the confirmed cluster, including the FULL transitive
external/core dependency closure and any dependency identity changes at target.

For each module in: <confirmed_cluster>
  Read the module's descriptor (`__manifest__.py`, or `__openerp__.py` on v8-v9); extract the `depends` list.
  Emit {module: str, path: str, depends: [str]}.

FULL TRANSITIVE CLOSURE (incl. external/core deps):
  Recursively collect ALL deps, including deps of in-cluster modules' deps that are
  external (not in-cluster) or core modules. For each dep at any level:
    check_module_exists(name='<dep>', odoo_version='<target_version>')
  Flag:
  - dep where exists=false at target as 'dep_missing_at_target: true'
  - dep where the module was RENAMED, MOVED, or SPLIT at target (e.g. a community module
    absorbed into core, or an account_* reorg): use api_version_diff + module_inspect to
    detect identity changes. Flag as 'dep_identity_changed: true' with the new identity.

Output: graph.md (YAML block listing each module + deps + missing flag + identity_changed flag)
```

The `Explore` worker is Write-constrained and returns this YAML in chat; the orchestrator
transcribes it into `graph.md` VERBATIM - no reformatting, no summarizing - per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/scouting-persistence-contract.md` clause 3 (verbatim per-agent
capture). After receiving graph.md, the orchestrator topo-sorts to produce `topo_order: []`
(leaves first). Append topo_order to graph.md.

### P1b - Deprecation audit (Skill tool: odoo-deprecation-audit)

Dispatch via Skill tool. Brief:
```
Source version: <source_version>
Target version: <target_version>
Modules: <confirmed_cluster as comma-separated list>
REPO_ROOT: <absolute path to the repository root>
MODULE_PATHS: <comma-separated absolute paths from intake.md candidate_modules[].path>
matched_profile: <matched_profile from intake.md>
Run the TARGET-version survival pass (symbols stable at <source> but deprecated/removed at
<target> - the upgrade-critical class find_deprecated_usage misses when pinned to source).
Output to: <ISOLATE_DIR>/modules-upgrade/<src>-<tgt>-<cluster>/deprecation.md
```

`odoo-deprecation-audit` has its own protocol (find_deprecated_usage + api_version_diff +
lookup_core_api rounds + TARGET-version survival pass). Do NOT replicate it here; it owns its own SSOT.
The upgrade orchestrator consumes its output as a per-module fix list in P4.

### P1c - Version delta (Skill tool: odoo-version-diff)

Dispatch via Skill tool. Brief:
```
From version: <source_version>
To version: <target_version>
Focus: developer track (API breaking changes, removed symbols, migration notes).
Output to: <ISOLATE_DIR>/modules-upgrade/<src>-<tgt>-<cluster>/version-delta.md
```

`odoo-version-diff` owns its own protocol. The upgrade orchestrator consumes its
Removed APIs + Changed signatures tables in P4 via the breaking-change catalog.

### P1d - Transitive Symbol Survey (Explore, sonnet, read-only)

P1a confirms a dep MODULE exists at target; it does NOT ground the SYMBOLS the cluster pulls
from that dep down to base/ORM/tools. P1d closes that gap: it grounds every external/core
symbol the cluster references AT THE TARGET, so a renamed/removed symbol surfaces in P1 instead
of crashing at P5.

```
TASK: Transitive symbol-survival survey for cluster '<cluster>' upgrading <src> -> <tgt>.
MODULE PATHS: <comma-separated absolute paths from intake.md candidate_modules[].path>

1. set_active_version(odoo_version='<target_version>').
2. Scan the cluster source for every symbol that references an EXTERNAL/core dependency
   (a dep NOT in the cluster): model `_inherit` / `env['<model>']` targets, fields read/written
   on those models, ORM chains 3+ levels deep, method calls/overrides, `env.ref` / template
   xml_ids, and manifest `depends` entries.
3. Ground EACH symbol at the target using OSM, REUSING the procedure in
   ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/fp-symbol-survival-check.md § 2 (per-symbol grounding) and
   § 2.5 (the seven autosilent symbol classes) BY PATH - do NOT copy the steps here. Use
   `model_inspect` / `entity_lookup` / `api_version_diff` / `resolve_orm_chain` / `check_module_exists`.
4. Classify each symbol: SURVIVED | RENAMED | REMOVED | TYPE_CHANGED.
   Emit ONLY the non-SURVIVED ones as `blockers[]` (RENAMED/REMOVED/TYPE_CHANGED) - these gate P3/P4.
   For a CUSTOM `_inherit`/symbol OSM cannot resolve, that is an OSM MISS (custom code is not
   indexed), NOT absence at target: confirm against module source and label `grounded: osm + local-source (hybrid)`.

FALLBACK: if OSM is unreachable, run the grep-only enumeration from § 2/§ 2.5 and label the
whole survey `grounded: local-source (not OSM-indexed)`; still emit best-effort blockers[].

OUTPUT: transitive-symbol-survey.md
FORMAT:
  cluster: <cluster>
  grounded: "osm" | "osm + local-source (hybrid)" | "local-source (not OSM-indexed)"
  blockers:
    - module: <module>          # the cluster module that references the symbol
      symbol: <symbol>
      kind: model|field|method|orm-chain|xml_id|depends
      status: RENAMED|REMOVED|TYPE_CHANGED
      target_equivalent: <new symbol or null>
      fix_hint: "<one line: how to rewrite the call site at target>"
```

This `Explore` worker is likewise Write-constrained; the orchestrator transcribes its returned
YAML into `transitive-symbol-survey.md` VERBATIM - no reformatting, no summarizing - per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/scouting-persistence-contract.md` clause 3 (verbatim per-agent
capture). The orchestrator feeds each module's `blockers[]` into P4 as that module's PREEMPTIVE
FIX LIST (prepended before the deprecation + breaking-change fixes).

### P1 gate

Assert: DAG is acyclic. On cycle: surface the cycle edges as a `concerns:` entry +
list the cycle + ask the user to break it before P2 proceeds (do NOT hard-fail).
Assert: no dep_missing_at_target or dep_identity_changed (if any flagged, surface as a
`concerns:` entry + list affected deps with their new identity or missing status +
ask user to confirm the resolution before P2).
Record P1d `blockers[]` for P3/P4; a non-empty blockers list is NOT a hard-fail (it is the
preemptive fix list), but list it in the P3 plan so the human sees what P4 will fix up front.

## P2 - Core-absorption dispatch briefs

Per module in dep order (topo_order from graph.md), parallel within the same dependency level
(modules at the same depth in the DAG). Concurrency: Mode B, model-weighted budget 8
per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/concurrency-guard.md`.

### P2 - odoo-diff-comparator brief (per module)

Model: sonnet (opus for a cluster-wide comparison or when the module has >500 LOC).

```
mode: upgrade
TASK: Core-absorption comparison for module '<module>' upgrading <src> -> <tgt>.

diff_scope: <path>
source_version: <source_version>
target_version: <target_version>
slug: <src>-<tgt>-<cluster>
repo_root: <absolute path to the repository root>
CLASSIFICATION TABLE: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/odoo-modules-upgrade/references/upg-classification-table.md

STEPS:
1. set_active_version(odoo_version='<target_version>')
2. Read the module source (models/, views/, security/, static/src/) via Read/Grep to
   understand its nghiệp vụ (business purpose), ý đồ (intent), expected outcomes,
   and acceptance criteria.
2a. DATA-AT-RISK CHECK: check the module's manifest for `installable: True`. If True,
   check whether the module defines stored non-computed fields (fields without
   `compute=` or `related=`, and with `store=True` or default store behavior) OR has
   `noupdate="1"` records in its data XML. If both conditions hold (installable:True +
   stored fields or noupdate records), set `data_at_risk: true` in the output.
   If `data_at_risk: true` and the forthcoming verdict is REWRITE(model) or DELETE,
   report BLOCKED and escalate to the orchestrator for human decision - do NOT proceed
   to classify as code-only.
2b. VERSION-ANCHORED DEFERRED-WORK SCAN (same read as step 2 - no separate dispatch): scan
   every file already read, PLUS `tests/*.py`, `data/*.xml`, `data/*.csv`, `i18n/*.po`, and any
   README/doc file (`README.rst`, `doc/*.rst`, `static/description/*.html`) present in the module,
   for a case-insensitive marker set: `TODO`, `todo`, `Todo`, `ToDo`, `@todo`, `FIXME`, `XXX`,
   `HACK`. For EACH hit, read the surrounding text and try to parse a VERSION ANCHOR - an Odoo
   series/major named in the marker (e.g. "17.0", "v17", "version 17", "when we move to 17",
   "upgrade to 17", "Odoo 17"). A bare number with no Odoo-version context ("fix by Q3",
   "issue #123") is NOT a version anchor. Classify:
   - DUE: anchored version == `<target_version>` (X) OR a series LOWER than X (already overdue -
     it should have been done at an earlier upgrade and was not).
   - DEFERRED: anchored version HIGHER than X - leave the marker untouched in source, not due yet.
   - UNANCHORED: no parseable version anchor. Do NOT force it into DUE. Record it with
     `needs_human: true` - never silently absorbed into DUE nor silently dropped.
   Emit a one-line `work_item` (the actionable description of what the marker asks for) for every
   DUE item only. This scan is part of the SAME delegated per-module read as step 2 - the
   orchestrator never greps module source itself for this; it only consumes the returned
   `deferred_work` block (see OUTPUT below).
3. For each FEATURE the module provides:
   a. Use check_module_exists / module_inspect / model_inspect to determine whether
      the target-version core ALREADY provides this feature.
   b. Use api_version_diff to check if the relevant API changed.
   c. Classify the feature per the classification table:
      - DELETE-absorbed: target core fully provides this (cite the core module/feature)
      - OBSOLETE: the module's purpose is moot at target but NO named core feature absorbs it
      - KEEP: custom logic that core does not provide and API is stable
      - REWRITE(api): API changed at target; custom logic still needed; adapt call sites
      - REWRITE(model): model structure changed (field renamed/type-changed/removed)
      - RECONCILE: custom intent survives BUT target-core now writes/computes the SAME business
        quantity on the SAME records (data-divergence), OR a new core mechanism can replace/
        simplify the custom impl -> route to P2b design (never a silent KEEP)
      - MERGE: this module + another cluster module are now best combined
      - SPLIT: this module has grown to warrant splitting
3b. NEW-FEATURE SWEEP (RECONCILE detection) - run for EVERY feature classified KEEP or
   REWRITE(api)/REWRITE(model).
   (a) API-endpoint sweep: if the api_version_diff result from step 3.b above contains a `new`
   section, inspect those new items for mechanisms that replace or simplify the feature - REUSE
   that same result; do NOT call api_version_diff again for the same feature.
   (b) UNCONDITIONAL domain sweep: run `suggest_pattern` / `find_examples` for EVERY KEEP
   feature regardless of the api_version_diff result. This catches new parallel core mechanisms
   (new model on the same domain, new mixin, new action) that do NOT appear in an
   endpoint-scoped api_version_diff but can replace the custom logic. A new parallel core
   mechanism on the same domain forces RECONCILE even when the feature's own API is stable.
   For each surviving custom feature, judge whether a NEW target-core mechanism/API can replace
   or materially simplify it AND still cover the feature's acceptance criteria. Evidence: the
   api_version_diff `new` items + `suggest_pattern` / `find_examples` / `describe_module`.
   - New core mechanism can wire-in and covers the criteria -> reclassify RECONCILE (b);
     record it in `reuse_candidates[]`.
   - New core ALSO writes/computes the SAME business quantity on the SAME records the custom
     code writes -> reclassify RECONCILE (a) data-divergence (two SSOTs).
   A RECONCILE feature sets the module verdict to RECONCILE (or MIXED if other features stay
   KEEP/REWRITE); the orchestrator routes that verdict to P2b design (§ P2b) - never a silent KEEP.
4. If EVERY feature is DELETE-absorbed, return verdict=DELETE-absorbed with
   the SINGLE core module/feature that replaces the whole module.
4a. BEHAVIORAL-EQUIVALENCE CHECK (MANDATORY for DELETE-absorbed verdict):
   Enumerate every override the module defines: `create`/`write`/`unlink`/`_compute_*`/
   `_constrains`/`@api.onchange`/action methods/SQL constraints. Use
   `model_inspect(model='<model>', method='methods', odoo_version='<target_version>')` + grep of models/ source. For EACH override:
   - confirm that target core produces the SAME observable effect, OR
   - confirm the override is a no-op against core behavior at target.
   If ANY override has no core equivalent with the same effect, change the verdict from
   DELETE-absorbed to REWRITE or MERGE - the module is NOT fully absorbed.
   Record the full enumeration in `behavioral_equivalence` in the output.
5. For each classification, provide:
   - evidence: OSM citation (module_inspect / model_inspect / api_version_diff result)
   - proposed_action: DELETE-absorbed / OBSOLETE / KEEP / REWRITE(api) / REWRITE(model) / MERGE / SPLIT

### P2 - odoo-gap-analysis dispatch (per module, parallel with comparator)

Dispatch via Skill tool. Brief:
```
Requirements: <list the module's features as requirements>
Target Odoo version: <target_version>
Context: This is for core-absorption analysis of module '<module>'.
         Determine for each requirement whether target-version core already provides it.
         Standard = core provides it natively -> DELETE candidate.
         Extension/Custom = still needs to be built -> KEEP/REWRITE candidate.
```

`odoo-gap-analysis` owns its own protocol. Its `Standard` verdict means "a customer could
get this requirement from core" - it is a SCOPING signal, NOT a delete-safety oracle.
Use its output as weak triangulation input only. The DELETE decision MUST rest on the
comparator's behavioral-equivalence proof (signal #5), not on a "Standard" gap-analysis tag.

---

## P2b - Hard-call design (conditional route-out)

Fires per the full design-trigger table in SKILL.md § P2b (SSOT; do not replicate the
condition list here).

Reuse the non-trivial criterion from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/odoo-solution-design/SKILL.md`
§ "When to invoke - and the non-trivial threshold" - do NOT invent a third definition.

Continuation Contract payload (emit verbatim, one route-out per module):

```yaml
status: paused-design
next: odoo-solution-design
inputs:
  return_to: odoo-modules-upgrade
  design_slug_hint: <src>-<tgt>-<cluster>-upg-<module>
  target_version: <target_version>
  modules: [<module>]
  intent_records: [<ISOLATE_DIR>/modules-upgrade/<src>-<tgt>-<cluster>/absorption/<module>.md]
  classification: "<verdict> - <one-line reason from absorption/<module>.md>"
```

`odoo-solution-design` under `return_to` runs its own design + design-approval gate, then emits
`next: odoo-modules-upgrade` with `design_doc`; it does NOT enter a code Plan Mode and does NOT
dispatch a coder (P3 Plan Mode + P4 coder are owned by THIS skill).

On re-entry (run-harness returns with `design_doc`): read the `design_doc` path from the returned
contract `inputs`; record it against the module; set `checkpoint.json` `<module>: designed`;
proceed to P3 with the design linked - do NOT re-run design. If `design_doc` is ABSENT from the
returned inputs (design crashed before producing it), set the module back to `<module>: absorbed`
and re-enter P2b next run rather than advancing to P3 with no design.

Multiple modules may trigger P2b in one cluster. Route them one at a time (the run-harness advances
one design hop per yield); a module whose status is already `designed` is skipped on the next P2b
pass. P3 Plan Mode is entered only after EVERY P2b-triggered module in the cluster has a recorded
`design_doc`.

---

## P3 - Plan Mode content template

Write this using the shared Plan-Mode gate
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/planning-gate-contract.md` § Plan-Mode enter/exit +
plan_mode_active) - between the `EnterPlanMode` and `ExitPlanMode` calls that gate reuses; this
skill does not define its own Plan-Mode mechanics.

## Upgrade Plan: <src> -> <tgt> for cluster <cluster>

### Per-module decision table
| Module | Action | Absorbing core / Reason (if DELETE/OBSOLETE) | Behavioral-equiv proof (if DELETE) | ADAPT tier | Design doc |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------|------------|
| <m1>   | DELETE-absorbed | account/reconcile_model | All 2 overrides (create, write) proven equivalent in core - see absorption/m1.md | n/a | n/a |
| <m4>   | OBSOLETE | Workflow evaporated: <reason> | n/a (no absorption) | n/a | n/a |
| <m2>   | REWRITE(api) | n/a | n/a | sonnet | n/a |
| <m3>   | KEEP | n/a | n/a | haiku | n/a |

**DELETE confirmations required (one per row - separate from plan approval):**
- [ ] Confirm DELETE m1 (absorbed by account/reconcile_model - behavioral equivalence verified) [y/N]
- [ ] Confirm DELETE m4 (OBSOLETE - <reason>) [y/N]

### Adapt order (dependency-first, leaves first)
1. <m3> (no custom deps in cluster)
2. <m2> (depends on m3)
3. DELETE <m1> (depends on m2; will be removed after m2 adapted)

### Manifest version (Rule A - NOT bumped)
# Do NOT bump the manifest `version` for any module in this cluster. Short form already -> leave it
# byte-identical; series-prefixed -> convert to `x.y.z` (dropping a prefix is not a bump).
# Remedy + form: references/upg-classification-table.md § Manifest breaks, the Rule A row.
- <m2>: 1.0.0 (unchanged)
- <m3>: 2.0.0 (unchanged)
- <m4>: <series>.2.1.0 -> 2.1.0 (series prefix dropped, numbers untouched)

### Commit plan
Each row in the classification table above becomes one commit, requested via
`git-toolkit:git-ops`: the files touched, the business outcome (module, source series, target
series, action taken), and `WORKTREE_PATH`. git-ops detects this repo's convention and composes
the message; do not compose or prescribe one.

### Risks
- <any dep_missing_at_target or dep_identity_changed flags from P1>
- <any data_at_risk: true modules from P2 - these BLOCK until human decision>
- <any ambiguous classification from P2>
```

After `ExitPlanMode` and user approval: write `plan.md` as the RECORD SSOT for P4+.

## P4 - Adapt dispatch briefs

### Integration worktree creation

Invoke the `git-toolkit:git-ops` skill (via the Skill tool; see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/git-delegation.md`) to add a worktree:
- op: worktree add
- branch: `upg/<src>-<tgt>-<cluster>`
- worktree: `<path>/upg-integration`
- base: `<work-base>`

### Child worktree per module (WORK tier)

For each module, delegate all mutations to git-toolkit via the `git-ops` skill (see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/git-delegation.md`):

**Collapse first (`n <= 1`).** `n` = the number of modules requiring a P4 dispatch in THIS cluster,
read from `plan.md`'s P3 classification table (count the rows whose action is KEEP, REWRITE(api),
REWRITE(model), MERGE, SPLIT or RECONCILE; DELETE-absorbed and OBSOLETE rows need no coder and do not
count). `n <= 1` -> SKIP steps 1-3 below: dispatch the one module DIRECTLY into
`<path>/upg-integration`. `n >= 2` -> steps 1-3 as written; the child worktree is there for
poison-containment, not for an `index.lock` race (P4 is "Per module in dep order" - sequential - so
that race never occurs here). Semantics:
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/run-harness/references/run-integration.md` § Single-unit collapse.

1. Create child worktree - invoke `git-toolkit:git-ops` to add a worktree (branch
   `upg/<src>-<tgt>-<cluster>-<module>`, worktree `<path>/upg-<module>`,
   base `upg/<src>-<tgt>-<cluster>`).

2. Dispatch coder to `<path>/upg-<module>`.

3. Converge back - invoke `git-toolkit:git-ops` (single request): merge branch
   `upg/<src>-<tgt>-<cluster>-<module>` into `upg/<src>-<tgt>-<cluster>` no-ff in
   worktree `<path>/upg-integration`; then remove worktree `<path>/upg-<module>`;
   then delete branch `upg/<src>-<tgt>-<cluster>-<module>`.

### odoo-coding dispatch brief (via Skill tool, per module)

```
ODOO VERSION: <target_version>
MODULE: <module>
MODULE PATH: <path>
ACTION: <DELETE-absorbed | OBSOLETE | KEEP | REWRITE(api) | REWRITE(model) | MERGE | SPLIT>
WORKTREE_PATH: <path>/upg-<module>
SHARE_DIR: <the SAME literal resolved at P0 intake, per `## Base` above - substitute it>
ISOLATE_DIR: <the SAME literal resolved at P0 intake - substitute it, never re-resolve. It keys
  on the enclosing repository root, so a coder that resolves it from inside upg-<module> writes the
  run's worklog into that per-module worktree, orphaned from absorption/ and checkpoint.json>

INPUTS:
- Absorption verdict: absorption/<module>.md
- Version-anchored deferred work DUE this upgrade (this module only): absorption/<module>.md
  `deferred_work` block, items with classification=DUE
- Preemptive fix list (this module's blockers[] - apply FIRST): transitive-symbol-survey.md
- Deprecation fix list (rows for this module only): deprecation.md
- Breaking-change catalog: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/odoo-modules-upgrade/references/upg-classification-table.md
- Version delta (Removed + Changed for relevant symbols): version-delta.md
- Design doc (if P2b produced one): <path or "none">
- Conventions (CORE, applies on EVERY profile/distribution - never Viindoo-gated; this IS a
  modules-upgrade adapt): ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/upg-conventions.md § Convention 0 - no
  old-series compatibility, no migration script, no version bump, implement any
  `reuse_candidates[]` target-core mechanism instead of a shim; see INSTRUCTIONS step 0c below
  for the vendor-currency pass (clause (c)).

ADAPT TIER: <haiku | sonnet | opus | fable> (from upg-triage-table.md)

INSTRUCTIONS:
If ACTION=DELETE-absorbed or ACTION=OBSOLETE:
  DANGLING-REFERENCE SWEEP (MANDATORY before directory removal):
  Grep the entire repo for references to the module's models, XML IDs, security groups,
  and env.ref targets that will become dangling after deletion:
    grep -rn "<module_model_names>" . --include="*.py" --include="*.xml" --include="*.csv"
    grep -rn "env.ref('<module>\." . --include="*.py"
    grep -rn "group_<module>" . --include="*.xml" --include="*.py" --include="*.csv"
    grep -rn "<xmlid from the module>" . --include="*.xml"
  The orchestrator pre-populates the module's model names (from absorption/<module>.md) and
  known XML IDs in the brief, sourced from `module_inspect(name='<module>', method='models',
  odoo_version='<source_version>')` + the module's data/security XML at SOURCE (the module is
  about to be deleted, so it is no longer at target - read it at source). For EACH dangling
  reference found: either rehome it to the absorbing core module/feature OR remove it.
  Document the rehoming decisions in the commit request's business-outcome description or an
  inline rehoming comment in the touched file.

  After the sweep, report findings to the orchestrator. The orchestrator then invokes
  the `git-toolkit:git-ops` skill (in this child worktree) to remove the module directory, stage the
  deletion, and commit -s (see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/git-delegation.md`).
  git-ops request fields:
    - op: rm -r module dir + stage deletion + commit -s
    - confirmed: yes - user confirmed DELETE <module> at P3 Plan Mode gate
    - business outcome (absorbed): delete <module> - absorbed by core <absorbing_core_feature> in <target_version> (no custom delta remains)
    - business outcome (obsolete): delete <module> - obsolete at <target_version> (<one-line reason why the need evaporated>)
  git-ops detects this repo's convention and composes the commit message from the business
  outcome above; do not compose or prescribe one.
  dependers: <list of modules pre-populated by the orchestrator from graph.md that list
  '<module>' in their depends - the orchestrator resolves this BEFORE dispatching the
  brief so the coder does not need to re-discover them>
  For each module in dependers[], remove '<module>' from that module's
  descriptor (`__manifest__.py`, or `__openerp__.py` on v8-v9) `depends` list.

If ACTION=KEEP/REWRITE(api)/REWRITE(model)/MERGE/SPLIT:
  0. PREEMPTIVE FIX LIST (apply FIRST): for every blocker attributed to this module in
     transitive-symbol-survey.md (status RENAMED/REMOVED/TYPE_CHANGED), rewrite the call site
     to its `target_equivalent` per `fix_hint`. These are external/core symbols that auto-survive
     a clean port yet break at install/runtime - fix them before the catalog passes below.
  0b. DUE VERSION-ANCHORED DEFERRED WORK: for every item in this module's absorption/<module>.md
     `deferred_work` block with classification=DUE, implement its `work_item` NOW - this is REAL
     upgrade work, not a side note, and goes through the SAME implement -> P4b review -> P5 test
     path as every other change in this module. Leave DEFERRED items untouched in source (a future
     upgrade will pick them up); an UNANCHORED item is NEVER silently resolved here - it stays
     flagged for the P6 human gate.
  0c. VENDOR-CURRENCY BIAS (Convention 0(c), CORE - apply on every profile): decide the trigger,
     run the capped WebFetch/WebSearch pass, and ACT on the finding (adapt to the newest upstream
     API or record a deferral) for any third-party import this module's adapt touches - trigger
     predicate, THREE-package cap, and the `vendor_api_checked:` outcome set are Convention 0(c)'s
     own text, not restated here:
     ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/upg-conventions.md § Convention 0(c). Persist the outcome as the
     `vendor_api_checked:` field in THIS module's `absorption/<module>.md` (reserved slot: § P2
     output FORMAT above) - the SAME file P6 presents, so the human sign-off sees it without a
     separate surfacing step.
  1. Apply all deprecation fix-list items for this module (from deprecation.md).
  2. Apply all breaking-change items that affect this module (from upg-classification-table.md).
  3. For REWRITE(model): update field references, compute methods, search/domain expressions,
     and XML views that reference changed/removed fields. ALSO sweep:
     - `data/*.xml` - update record field values, domain attrs, and field refs
     - `demo/*.xml` - same as data/
     - `security/*.csv` (ir.model.access.csv) - update model names if model was renamed
     - `ir.rule` records - update domain expressions referencing renamed/removed fields
  4. Do NOT bump the manifest `version`: already short -> leave it byte-identical; series-prefixed
     -> CONVERT it to `x.y.z` by dropping the prefix (not a bump). Remedy + form:
     upg-classification-table.md § Manifest breaks, the Rule A row. Leave any existing `migrations/`
     dir from a lower series untouched (SERIES-UPGRADE scope) and write no new script.
  4b. Set `installable: True` (flip from False) AFTER all other P4 fixes are applied, BEFORE P5
     runs - per the upg-classification-table.md manifest-break row. P5 confirms it installs.
  4c. Scan each module descriptor (BOTH names) for `# TODO: Uncomment when upgrading` markers left by the
     forward-port skill. Restore `auto_install`/`application` ONLY when the breadcrumb explicitly
     directs it - do NOT auto-detect from module name or depends structure. (This breadcrumb is a
     distinct, narrower convention from the general version-anchored deferred-work reconciliation
     in step 0b above - it is auto_install/application-specific, not a due-vs-deferred marker.)
  5. Write or adapt tests: test the adapted behavior, not the old source text. RED first.
  The coders run NO git; after they write their files the orchestrating skill (odoo-coding) commits
  via the git-toolkit:git-ops skill (DCO -s sign-off; per snippets/git-delegation.md).
  Commit request: files touched + business outcome (<module> <source_version>-><target_version> -
  <ACTION> <one-line summary>) + `WORKTREE_PATH`; git-ops composes the message.

AUTONOMOUS FIX: if the P5 install+test run returns a failure for this module, you will
be re-dispatched with the root cause from the debugger. Fix to that root cause only.
```

---

## P4b - Code-review loop (in-pipeline; per module, dep order; fix-until-clean before install)

Goal: review each adapted module's diff BEFORE P5's ephemeral-instance install/test (run one
dependency level at a time), fixing in a loop until no CRITICAL/HIGH remains. Two review points exist: this in-pipeline loop
and the final P7 dep-order review of the integration worktree, which runs ahead of the PR - do NOT
remove P7.

For each adapted module in topo_order (leaves first); skip DELETE-absorbed/OBSOLETE (no adapt diff):

```
SKILL: odoo-code-review
TARGET: worktree:<path>/upg-integration
SCOPE: module '<module>' adapt diff only (the module's adapt commit); attribute findings to
       adapted lines only.
SERIES: <target_version>
CONTEXT: cross-major upgrade <src>-><tgt>; verdict <KEEP|REWRITE(api)|REWRITE(model)|MERGE|SPLIT>;
         design doc (if P2b produced one): <path or none>.
ASK: severity-graded findings (CRITICAL/HIGH/MED/LOW) + corrected version.
```

Loop + escalate (per module):
1. No CRITICAL/HIGH -> write `<module>: reviewed`, move to the next module.
2. CRITICAL/HIGH present -> dispatch `odoo-coding` (AUTONOMOUS FIX sentinel + the findings) at the
   module's ADAPT tier to fix to root cause; re-review that module. Record MED/LOW in the module's
   row for the P7 review, do not block.
3. Cap = 3 review->fix iterations per module. 3rd still CRITICAL/HIGH -> STOP, escalate BLOCKED
   per ETHOS #7 (which module, which finding, what was tried).
Proceed to P5 ONLY when EVERY adapted module is `reviewed` clean. The gate is automated; human
STOP-gates stay at P6/P7.

---

## P5 - Install + test gate format

Install bottom-up one dependency level at a time (leaves first) so
failures localize to the level that introduced them and resume skips proven levels.
Per-level green is recorded in `checkpoint.json` (status `installed` per module) and
`install-test.md`.

**Framework-validation gate is MERGED into P5 (no separate phase) and runs demo=on.** A module
that flips `installable: False -> True` is scanned by the target's FULL test suite for the first
time; from v18 `base.TestInvisibleField` (every always-invisible view field needs an explanatory
XML comment) and `hr.TestSelfAccessProfile` (custom `hr.employee` fields need
`groups='hr.group_hr_user'`) run in that suite and require demo data. Demo default is
version-keyed - F0 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/odoo-version-pivots.md:
v8-v18 demo ON by default (`--without-demo` disables); v19 demo OFF by default (`--with-demo`
enables); `--without-demo=False` is INVALID. The gate stays demo=on regardless
(on v19 the instance must be created `--with-demo`). The P4b review for any flipped module MUST
additionally cover ACL / `.sudo()` for every create/write/compute override on a widely-used core
model. Cross-ref ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/odoo-modules-upgrade/references/runbot-parity-checklist.md.

Step 1 - create instance (once), demo=on:
```
operation: create
series: <target_version>
demo: on   # framework-validation gate REQUIRES demo data (see note above); on v19 -> --with-demo
SHARE_DIR: <the SAME literal resolved at P0 intake, per `## Base` above - substitute it>
ISOLATE_DIR: <the SAME literal resolved at P0 intake - substitute it, never re-resolve>
WORKTREE_PATH: <path>/upg-integration   # the SAME P4 integration worktree (§ Integration worktree
                                         # creation above); forwarded verbatim as odoo-instance's
                                         # own WORKTREE_PATH field (odoo-instance/SKILL.md §
                                         # WORKTREE_PATH substitution), so ALLOCATOR acquires with
                                         # --addons-path-override covering it - this is what P5.7
                                         # depends on ("its addons path MUST cover WORKTREE_PATH")
```

For each dependency level in topo_order (leaves first), run Steps 2-3 before moving to the next level:

Step 2 - init (install) this level's modules:
```
operation: init
series: <target_version>
modules: <FULL transitive closure of THIS LEVEL's modules - including external/core deps from
          graph.md P1a's full closure - plus all previously installed modules, comma-separated;
          re-specifying deps ensures Odoo's dep-order logic holds and no external dep is skipped>
CONFIRM: "confirm each module in this level emits a Loading line; report per-module install status"
```

Step 3 - run tests for this level:
```
operation: run-tests
series: <target_version>
modules: <THIS LEVEL's modules only, comma-separated>
flags: --test-enable
test_tags: <`/<m>` for every module in THIS LEVEL, comma-joined - the same set as `modules`, so the
           level's own suites run and the transitive core closure installed in Step 2 does not.
           Untagged here would test every module the level pulled in, `base` upward, on EVERY level.
           SSOT: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/test-scope-contract.md>
CONFIRM: "report per-module test result for this level"
```

After each level: write level result to `install-test.md` and update `checkpoint.json`
(set `installed` for each module in the level that passed). On FAILURE in a level:
dispatch `odoo-backend-debugger` or `odoo-ui-debugger` with the traceback + module source, plus
`ISOLATE_DIR:` (the SAME literal resolved at P0 intake, per `## Base` above) and
`SLUG: <cluster>-level<n>` (this skill's own `<cluster>` scope slug from `SKILL.md` § The
pipeline plus this failing level's number `<n>`) - `odoo-ui-debugger` substitutes both literals to compose
`<ISOLATE_DIR>/visual/debug/<cluster>-level<n>/` for its own captured evidence, correlated
to the failing level, and MUST NOT re-resolve or improvise one from its own cwd.
Receive proven root cause -> feed back to P4 for the affected module only (dispatch
`odoo-coding` with `AUTONOMOUS FIX` sentinel + root cause). Re-run P5 FROM THE FAILING
LEVEL (skip levels already recorded as `installed` in `checkpoint.json`).

Final `install-test.md` schema:

```yaml
# install-test.md
cluster: <cluster>
target_version: <target_version>
levels:
  - level: <n>
    modules: [<m1>, <m2>]
    install_ok: true | false
    test_result: passed | failed | error
    root_cause: null | "<proven root cause from debugger>"
per_module:
  - module: <m>
    level: <n>
    install_ok: true | false
    test_result: passed | failed | error
    root_cause: null | "<proven root cause from debugger>"
overall: green | red
```

Backward-compat read (one release only): a ledger written before this release carries `waves:` /
`wave: <wave_number>` instead of `levels:` / `level: <n>` - on resume, read those old keys as
`levels:` / `level:` (same meaning, same numbering), then rewrite the file in the new key names on
the next update to this pipeline. An in-flight upgrade must never be stranded by the rename.

---

## P5.7 - i18n reconcile (MANDATORY; narrow escape only)

Wires the EXISTING `odoo-i18n` skill as a post-install phase - no new i18n logic. Non-destructive
is load-bearing: re-exporting a `.po` from a fresh DB with NO load step destroys 40-90% of existing
`msgstr`, so translation MEMORY is always forwarded by loading the existing `.po` into a fresh
instance before re-export, then diff-reviewed - never blind-regenerated.

MANDATORY for every SURVIVING module of the cluster - KEEP, REWRITE(api), REWRITE(model), MERGE, SPLIT
and RECONCILE all pass through the target series' export/reconcile path once. A content diff is NOT the
gate: the `.pot`/`.po` TOOLING changes across a major series independently of whether this module's own
strings changed. The ONLY skips are the enumerated escapes in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/i18n-mandate-contract.md` § Escape hatches, and each one is RECORDED in
`install-test.md` - never silent. DELETE-absorbed and OBSOLETE modules skip via E1.

When it runs (against the P5 instance, demo=on):
```
SKILL: odoo-i18n
INSTANCE: the P5 ephemeral instance (already up) - its addons path MUST cover WORKTREE_PATH
          (established at P5 Step 1's own WORKTREE_PATH field, above)
MODULES: <cluster adapted modules>
TARGET_VERSION: <target_version>
MODE: reconcile (non-destructive)
WORKTREE_PATH: <the P4 integration worktree - .po/.pot are git-tracked>
SHARE_DIR: <the SAME literal resolved at P0 intake, per `## Base` above - substitute it>
ISOLATE_DIR: <the SAME literal resolved at P0 intake - substitute it, and do NOT re-resolve or
  improvise one from a worktree cwd>
TARGET LANGUAGES: <explicit list when this run has one, else omit the field entirely - this
  orchestrator has no tiered resolver of its own; odoo-i18n's own P0 tiers 2-4 (registry /
  .po-filename inference / instance query) still attempt resolution from what IS available, and
  record escape E3 (proceed, no stop) only once all four tiers are empty. odoo-i18n has no
  hardcoded target-language default to fall back on - omitting the field never triggers one; it
  only ever reaches escape E3 above (i18n-mandate-contract.md; odoo-i18n/SKILL.md P0)>
GATE: do NOT stop separately - return the result; it is presented at the P6 sign-off
STEPS (odoo-i18n owns the detail; do NOT replicate its protocol):
  1. fresh instance with en_US + each existing <lang>.po loaded, then re-export each <lang>.po
  2. git-ops diff-review each re-exported <lang>.po against its committed version; adjudicate every removed/changed msgid correct (term gone) or wrong (BLOCK) - preserves every existing msgstr except an adjudicated-correct loss
  3. hand-translate ONLY the residual untranslated entries
  4. reload with `-u <module>` on the instance and confirm the catalog loads
```
Output: `i18n-reconcile.md` (per-module: residual count, translated count, skipped?).

---

## Commit consolidation (P6/P7 capability)

"No cluster-squash" means: NEVER collapse the whole cluster into ONE opaque commit - the
per-module commit messages ARE the upgrade record. It does NOT forbid consolidating a single
module's WIP/fixup commits into ONE clean commit per module. Per-module consolidation is ALLOWED
and preferred when a module accumulated fixups during P4/P4b.

Delegate the entire consolidation sequence to git-toolkit via the `git-ops` skill for each module in dependency order
(see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/git-delegation.md`):
- op: consolidate module commits in integration worktree
- worktree: `<path>/upg-integration`
- scope: `<module>/` subtree only (do NOT stage other modules)
- base: the first commit SHA recorded by the orchestrator for this module (see note below)
  NOTE: The orchestrator MUST record each module's first commit SHA returned by the
  git-ops converge step and pass it as `base` in this request. Do not re-discover
  the base from the log - when modules' commits interleave, log-based discovery is
  ambiguous. Fallback when no recorded SHA: `<work-base>`.
- business outcome: <module> <src>-><tgt> - <ACTION> <summary> (signed via git-ops; git-ops
  detects this repo's convention and composes the message from the business outcome - do not
  compose or prescribe one)
- confirmed: yes - Plan Mode approved at P3 (consolidation listed in commit plan; backup ref created by git-ops)
- Steps git-ops performs: safety backup ref at HEAD -> reset-mixed to base ->
  stage `<module>/` only -> commit -s -> tree-identity verify (`git diff --quiet`
  backup vs HEAD; must be TREE-IDENTICAL) -> delete backup ref.
- tree-identity verify is the git-toolkit S6 step; on S6 failure git-ops returns BLOCKED
  (gate_hit: S6 tree-identity mismatch). Recovery: invoke `git-toolkit:git-ops` to restore
  from the backup ref (hard-reset to backup-ref) and escalate BLOCKED per ETHOS #7
  listing the differing trees.

Autosquash alternative: invoke `git-toolkit:git-ops` with autosquash enabled;
git-ops handles the non-TTY environment natively.
Keep exactly ONE commit per module; never one commit per cluster.

## P7 - Final review, then PR creation command

Stage order inside this phase is the **Terminal stage order** constant
(${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/run-harness/references/run-integration.md § Pre-PR tail, its ONE
owner): checklist -> final dep-order review -> push -> open PR. Do not reorder it locally.

**Pre-PR checklist (extends P6 sign-off).** Run the Runbot parity gates
(${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/odoo-modules-upgrade/references/runbot-parity-checklist.md) PLUS
these three passes before opening the PR, each cross-referencing its owning snippet:
- Convention-compliance: manifest version-form is the short form with no series prefix and no bump
  (references/upg-classification-table.md § Manifest breaks, the Rule A row), always-invisible view
  fields carry an explanatory XML comment from v18, renames done via `old_technical_name` with no
  NEW migration script for no-data modules - per ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/upg-conventions.md.
  Scope marker: that no-new-script rule is about a MODULE RENAME; an existing lower-series
  `migrations/` dir carried by this SERIES UPGRADE is simply left untouched, never retargeted here.
- Perf-lens: no per-record `mapped()` aggregate over a high-volume model (`hr.attendance`,
  `stock.move`, `account.move.line`, `account.analytic.line`) in a stored compute - use a grouped
  `_read_group`.
- i18n: P5.7 ran for every surviving module, or each skip is a RECORDED enumerated escape
  (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/i18n-mandate-contract.md` § Escape hatches) - never a silent
  content-diff skip.

**Final dep-order review (runs BEFORE the push and the PR - it can force CODE CHANGES).**
Delegate the review of the integration worktree with the brief below, fix every CRITICAL/HIGH
finding on `<path>/upg-integration` (dispatch `odoo-coding` at the module's ADAPT tier, the SAME
loop shape as § P4b), and review again until none remains; MED/LOW are recorded on the module rows
of `install-test.md`. Only when it returns no CRITICAL/HIGH do the push and PR steps below run - a
review landing on an already-open PR makes the PR churn and leaves regression testing chasing a
moving target.

Review delegation brief:
```
TARGET: worktree:<path>/upg-integration
REVIEW ORDER: <topo_order from graph.md> (leaves first)
CONTEXT: cross-major upgrade <src>-><tgt> for cluster <cluster>
         modules in scope: <cluster_list>
         breaking changes applied: see version-delta.md
         deleted modules: <delete_list> (absorbed by core or obsolete - do NOT raise business findings for these)
```

**PR body construction (pre-render from structured artifacts - not grep of plan.md prose):**
The orchestrator constructs adapted-modules and deleted-modules lists from the structured
verdict data it holds at this point (not by grepping plan.md prose, which risks false-positives).
PR body template:

<orchestrator inlines the list of REWRITE/KEEP/MERGE/SPLIT modules from the
 structured verdict list built during P2-P4 - one line per module with action>

### Modules deleted
<orchestrator inlines the list of DELETE-absorbed + OBSOLETE modules with their
 reasons - sourced from the structured verdict list, not grep of plan.md prose>

### Test result
See <ISOLATE_DIR>/modules-upgrade/<src>-<tgt>-<cluster>/install-test.md - all levels green.

### Review request
Please review modules in dependency order (leaves first):
<topo_order from graph.md>
```

**Push and open PR - invoke `git-toolkit:git-ops` in sequence (see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/git-delegation.md`):**
1. Push branch - invoke `git-toolkit:git-ops` to push `upg/<src>-<tgt>-<cluster>` to the fork remote
   (resolve fork remote URL from `git remote get-url origin` or a dedicated fork remote).
2. Open PR - invoke `git-toolkit:git-ops` to create the PR: upstream org/repo and base branch resolved
   from `git remote get-url origin`; head `upg/<src>-<tgt>-<cluster>`; title
   `<cluster> cluster upgrade <src>-><tgt>`; body from the PR body template above.

After the PR exists, only PR-OBSERVING work remains: CI-failure triage and the human merge. Do NOT
delegate another worktree review here - the final review above already cleared.
