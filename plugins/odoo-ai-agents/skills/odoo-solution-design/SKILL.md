  Design the technical solution for a non-trivial Odoo change BEFORE code is written - the design step
  between requirement analysis (odoo-brl / odoo-gap-analysis) and coding (odoo-coding). Dispatches the
  odoo-solution-architect agent to produce a gate-able Technical Design Document grounded in OSM. Use it
  to decide HOW to build (inheritance axis, stored vs computed, new module vs extend) - not just WHAT to
  build or to immediately WRITE code. Fire on: "how should I architect/structure this", "design the
  solution / data model", "which approach", "plan the refactor", "technical design". Vietnamese: "thiết kế
  giải pháp", "phân tích thiết kế", "chọn cách tiếp cận nào", "lên kế hoạch refactor". For ONE method's
  hook use odoo-override-finding; to WRITE code use odoo-coding; to REVIEW use odoo-code-review; to
  classify a requirement LIST use odoo-brl / odoo-gap-analysis; for the build ORDER of an approved design
  use odoo-planning; for usage/walkthrough scenarios use odoo-doc-walkthrough
---

## Where this sits in the flow (design precedes the code Plan Mode)

Planning/analysis step only. Output: `<SHARE_DIR>/designs/…` (gitignored, L1; resolve `<SHARE_DIR>`
once per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/state-root-resolution.md`; substitute the captured
absolute path - never write the placeholder or a bare `.odoo-ai/` into a Read/Write/Edit) - never
production source. Correct order:

```
design (architect writes the TDD)  →  HUMAN approves the design  →  Plan Mode for the code  →  code → review
```

The approved TDD is the plan the code Plan Mode executes; do not flip this order.

## Input port - gap-analysis artifact (read before designing)

Before dispatching the architect, look for a gap-analysis artifact on disk - the per-requirement
classification/effort is the design PRECONDITION, read it; do NOT re-derive the tier from
conversational text:

- **Glob** `<SHARE_DIR>/gap-analysis/*/gap-matrix.jsonl` (newest dir wins); the consultant path
  may instead carry BRL output under `<SHARE_DIR>/brl/*/` - accept either source.
- **Found:** READ it. Each `gap-matrix.jsonl` line is one requirement with keys `req_id` ·
  `requirement` · `coverage` (full|partial|none) · `classification`
  (standard|config|extension|custom) · `effort_tier` (S|M|L|XL) · `module` · `grounded` ·
  `notes`. Use `classification` + `effort_tier` per requirement to decide WHICH requirements
  need a TDD and at what depth (extension/custom + L/XL drive the design; standard/config with
  a single obvious approach skip DESIGN and route straight to `odoo-planning` instead - planning
  is mandatory for all work, see "Skip DESIGN for trivial work" below). Cite the artifact path in the
  design doc and pass it to the architect (`GAP_MATRIX:` line in the P1 template). When
  the artifact exists it is authoritative - do NOT re-derive tiers from memory.
- **Not found AND the change is non-trivial:** recommend running `odoo-gap-analysis` first to
  classify/cost the requirements rather than guessing the tier. Not finding one is NOT a
  blocker: dispatch the architect with the `GAP_MATRIX:` line omitted and it measures the
  scope itself before designing (`agents/odoo-solution-architect.md`
  § Round 1 - Gather context). Running the gap analysis here first is still preferable
  when a human wants to gate the cost separately - it is a sequencing choice, never a
  precondition you stall on. (Trivial single-approach change: proceed without it.)

## Before dispatch - no scope-preview gate, one scope QUESTION

Do NOT ask the human to approve a scope preview before dispatching the architect. Whoever sent
the work here already gated that same decision: the front door (`odoo-intake`) approved scope,
approach and expected output with the human, and a `return_to` caller (e.g. `odoo-forward-port`)
classified scope itself. Asking again is friction, not safety. The single approval checkpoint this
skill owns is the § Design-approval gate, after the architect returns - one design, one gate, the
same shape the sibling self-driving front doors use (`odoo-forward-port` P4, `odoo-git-rebase` P6,
`odoo-modules-upgrade` P3).

The architect writes ONLY the design doc under the machine-global `$ODOO_AI_HOME` state root
(two-axis convention: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/state-root-resolution.md`), never source
files, so nothing irreversible happens before that gate.

Ask only genuine open questions, in ONE short message. There is exactly ONE such question, and
only when the multi-module trigger below fires - it settles something no upstream gate settled:
whether this scope is designed as one document or split per module.

**Multi-module scope trigger.** Do NOT assess module architecture yourself - whether modules need
new models, new inheritance axes, or share a cross-module contract is `odoo-solution-architect`'s
read, not this skill's. READ the trigger off the enumeration artifact instead; it fires only when
BOTH declared facts hold:
- The enumeration below resolves MORE THAN ONE module in scope.
- The upstream classification (`odoo-brl` / `odoo-gap-analysis`) already carries a Custom-XL or
  Extension-L item in at least two of those modules.

Both are values already written in an artifact you have. When the artifact does not carry one, ASK
for that fact in the same short message - never infer it from module names or from the request text.

Module enumeration priority (first available): deep-survey `synthesis.md` → brl `dag.json`
→ modules-upgrade `graph.md` → fallback: scan each module descriptor (`__manifest__.py`, or
`__openerp__.py` on v8-v9) + topo-sort `depends`
(pattern: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/odoo-modules-upgrade/SKILL.md` § P1(a)).

When it fires - and ONLY then - ask (never for a single-module or narrowly-scoped design):

```
This change spans <n> modules. Design it as one document, or one per module?
  approve-single        - one design covering the whole scope (default; use when in doubt)
  approve-master-child  - one overall design plus one per module (see Decompose branch)
  cancel
```

Default is `approve-single`.

**`approve-single`:** MUST set `MODE: single` in the architect dispatch brief (P1
template). Without this explicit field, the architect's decompose-bounce heuristic may re-evaluate
scope as multi-module, return `NEEDS_NEXT`, and loop instead of writing the TDD.

**The architect owns the single-vs-master call when the trigger does NOT fire.** The P1 template
carries no `MODE:` line, so a design dispatched without the scope question still passes through the
decompose bounce (`agents/odoo-solution-architect.md` § Dispatch modes), which returns `NEEDS_NEXT`
recommending master-child when the scope genuinely needs splitting. A trigger that stayed silent is
therefore recoverable at the specialist - which is why this skill never has to pre-judge the
architecture to protect against it.

---

## Decompose branch (master-child mode)

Only entered when the user replied `approve-master-child` to the scope question above.
Contract SSOT: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/master-child-design-contract.md`.
Artifact root: `<SHARE_DIR>/designs/<master-slug>/`.

**a. Master TDD dispatch.** Dispatch `odoo-solution-architect` with `MODE: master`. Architect
produces `_master-<date>.md` (cross-module altitude: §10 shared-symbol registry, dep directions,
integration-module decisions - NOT module internals) and `index.yaml` (per contract schema).
Use same prompt template as P1 below; add `MODE: master`.

**b. Master gate (human, MANDATORY).** Present master TDD summary: §10 symbol count, dep order,
top cross-module risks. Gate: `approve-master` (default) / `review-master` (opt-in - dispatch
`odoo-solution-architect MODE: review` for a fresh-spawn adversarial pass over the master TDD,
then re-present this gate with its FINDINGS) / `refine: [feedback]` / `cancel`. No child dispatch
before this clears. The approved master §10 is the hard constraint for all children.

**c. DAG fan-out (child TDDs) - base-first by `dag_layer`.** After master gate:
- Read `dag_layers` from `index.yaml` (topo order is encoded in list order). `dag_layer` is the
  SHARED axis for both concurrency and dependency: same layer = parallel, different layer =
  strict order. Dispatch `odoo-solution-architect` `MODE: child` per module, following **Mode B**
  (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/concurrency-guard.md`) for the same-layer batch. ALL
  children of layer `k` must reach `designed` (see checkpoint step below) before ANY child of
  layer `k+1` is dispatched - never mix layers in one dispatch batch.
- Dispatch order only, not the §10 contract mechanism: the master §10 shared-symbol registry still
  front-loads every cross-module contract (step a), so no child blocks on a sibling for interface
  discovery. Base-first reduces `MODE: consistency` rework by catching §10 gaps against a concrete
  lower-layer design early.
- **Model floor: opus.** Scale toward fable for modules with a new inheritance axis (same
  fable-confirmation rule as single mode).
- Layer-0 child brief includes `MODE: child`, `CHILD_MODULE: <name>`, `MASTER_DESIGN_DOC: <abs
  path>`, `ODOO_VERSION: <version>`. Every layer `k>=1` child brief additionally carries
  `UPSTREAM_CHILD_DESIGNS: [<abs path to each already-authored lower-layer child TDD it
  depends_on>]` ALONGSIDE `MASTER_DESIGN_DOC`. Child cites master §10 for every cross-module
  symbol it references.
- Same-layer children cannot reach each other, so reconciliation is DISPATCHED here, never decided
  here. After the whole layer returns, read `<SHARE_DIR>/designs/<master-slug>/contested-symbols.md`
  and dispatch `odoo-solution-architect` `MODE: reconcile` with that file, the master TDD, and the
  contested sections of the two child TDDs in dispute. That pass is the actor that decides each
  contested symbol against master §10 and returns one verdict row per symbol (winner, loser,
  evidence, or `UNRESOLVED`). YOU do not pick the winner and do not weigh the proposals: write the
  returned verdicts into the master TDD verbatim, and re-dispatch ONLY the children whose proposal
  lost, with the verdict in their brief. ONE reconciliation round per layer; any `UNRESOLVED`
  verdict, or a round that leaves a symbol open -> the layer is BLOCKED for a human. Full contract:
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/master-child-design-contract.md` § Contested-symbol reconciliation.
- After each child subagent returns, YOU (the orchestrating main agent) write `status: designed`
  for that module to `index.yaml` (checkpoint for resume on interruption) - confirm every module
  in the current layer is `designed` before dispatching the next layer's batch.

**d. Consistency pass (MANDATORY after all children `designed`).** Dispatch
`odoo-solution-architect` `MODE: consistency`. Reads CONTRACT SUBSET of each child (§1 Intent,
§9 Acceptance Criteria - confirming each child carries its own MANDATORY module-level AC block with
the INDEPENDENCE GUARD honored (expected values requirement-derived, never code/OSM-derived) -
cross-module fields/models/deps - NOT full body) + master §10. CONSUMES the child TDDs plus
`contested-symbols.md` and the `MODE: reconcile` verdicts on it (`master-child-design-contract.md`
§ Contested-symbol reconciliation) and is the SOLE §10/`index.yaml` applier -
children never write §10 themselves. Reconciles any remaining seams, emits `conflict-list.md`
(split LEAD-RESOLVED vs ESCALATED) at the artifact root.

**e. Batch gate (human, single gate for all children).** Present conflict-list split into ESCALATED
seams (the human decides these - the only seams needing a decision; MANDATORY - state explicitly if
none) and LEAD-RESOLVED seams (already settled by a `MODE: reconcile` verdict the lead applied -
list EVERY one as its own line: symbol, winning contract, whose proposal lost, and the evidence; a
bare count hides a wrong verdict behind a number) + per-child TDD summaries
(approach, top risk, data-model delta). Gate: `approve-all` (default) / `review-children` (opt-in -
dispatch `odoo-solution-architect MODE: review` over the domain-close child clusters that sit on the
same dependency chain, then re-present this gate with FINDINGS) / `refine:<module>: [feedback]` /
`cancel`. A `refine:<module>` re-dispatches that child only, re-runs consistency pass, then
re-presents this gate. One batch gate total - escalated seams fold INTO this single gate, never a
separate gate. On `approve-all`, write `status: approved` for all modules in `index.yaml`.

**f. Continuation Contract (master-child).** Emit per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/continuation-contract.md`. All paths are the absolute resolved
`<SHARE_DIR>` paths (never repo-root-relative or subdir-relative; resolve+substitute per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/state-root-resolution.md`); `child_path` under `design_docs` MUST
be the full absolute path (not relative to subdir):

```yaml
status: NEEDS_NEXT
next: <return_to or odoo-planning>
inputs:
  design_index: <SHARE_DIR>/designs/<master-slug>/index.yaml
  master_design_doc: <SHARE_DIR>/designs/<master-slug>/_master-<date>.md
  design_docs:
    - module: <name>
      child_path: <SHARE_DIR>/designs/<master-slug>/<name>-<date>.md
```

Do NOT emit bare `design_doc:` (single-mode only). Do NOT put `design_index` /
`master_design_doc` / `design_docs` as bare top-level keys - they belong under `inputs:`.
`next:` same rule as single mode: `return_to` SET → `next: <return_to>`; UNSET →
`next: odoo-planning` (the planner consumes `index.yaml` `dag_layers` and turns it into
an execution plan before any code is written - it is the first consumer of the design
DAG; the coders later follow the plan's node order rather than `dag_layers` directly).

---

## Role

Odoo solution architect. Turns a classified requirement (or upgrade/migration/refactor goal)
into a production-ready and reviewable design the user approves before any production code is generated.
Pairs with `odoo-coding` (consumes the design) and `odoo-code-review` (checks implementation vs design).

## When to invoke - and the non-trivial threshold

Launch `odoo-solution-architect` as a subagent for **non-trivial** changes. Fire for ANY of:

- **Extension-L / Custom-XL** tier (from `odoo-brl` / `odoo-gap-analysis`).
- **A new module**, new model, or module restructure.
- **Overriding a core ORM hook** (`create` / `write` / `unlink`) or a method with ≥3 entries
  in its override chain.
- **A schema / data migration** with more than one viable strategy.
- **A cross-model computed chain**, multi-company / multi-currency / multi-branch (v17+), or a
  full-stack feature spanning backend + frontend.
- **A localization touch** needing a generic-before-localization decision, or a new
  `application=True` module needing the standard app-menu shape (root + Reports + Configuration).
- **A refactor** (mixin extraction, module split/merge, inheritance axis change).

The architect surveys **bidirectional impact** and designs **dynamic demo data** for any new
end-user behavior - see `agents/odoo-solution-architect.md` for the template.

**Skip DESIGN for trivial work:** a single Standard/Config field, boilerplate (one computed field,
a view shell, a security CSV row), or a localized fix with exactly one obvious approach - but still
route to `odoo-planning`, because planning is mandatory for all work
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/planning-gate-contract.md` § Mandatory-planning rule). If unsure:
"this looks like a one-approach change - design it first, or plan it directly?"

## Out of Scope

- **Writing production code** → `odoo-coding` (backend Python/XML + frontend JS/OWL/SCSS)
- **Reviewing existing code** → `odoo-code-review`
- **Finding ONE method's hook location** → `odoo-override-finding` (this skill designs the whole
  solution; override-finding answers a single "where do I hook" question)
- **Classifying / costing a requirement list** → `odoo-brl` (large) or `odoo-gap-analysis` (short)
- **Version-to-version API delta** → `odoo-version-diff`; **deprecation scan** → `odoo-deprecation-audit`
- **User workflow narrative or happy-path usage scenarios for documentation** -> `odoo-doc-walkthrough`. This skill designs technical architecture BEFORE code; it does NOT author user-facing walkthrough text or scenario docs

## MCP tools

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED TOOLS -->
> **Pick the right tool first.** Odoo Semantic (the odoo-semantic-mcp server) is the INDEXED Odoo source-code knowledge graph: a pre-built graph + vector index of Odoo source across every indexed Odoo version (legacy through latest) and repos/editions, with inheritance, override, and cross-module impact already resolved. It gives AUTHORITATIVE STRUCTURAL facts about how Odoo source IS DEFINED, with no local checkout needed. Unique signature: indexed, cross-version, inheritance-resolved, whole-graph, checkout-free. It is a STATIC index with NO runtime/live data.
>
> This is your PRIMARY, context-efficient source for Odoo source/structure questions - the Odoo codebase is huge and reading it directly burns context, so prefer Odoo Semantic first. Order of precedence: (1) Odoo Semantic available -> use it; (2) available but it lacks the specific detail -> THEN read the source (Read/Grep your checkout) to fill that gap; (3) unavailable -> read the source. Reading code is the FALLBACK, never the first move when Odoo Semantic can answer.
>
> Do NOT use Odoo Semantic for:
> - LIVE DATA / runtime - actual record values, search/read/write real records, executing a method, this instance's installed modules -> use a live Odoo MCP server (one exposing read_record/search_records/execute_method), NOT Odoo Semantic.
>
> Look-live-but-static tools (return indexed source, never runtime data): `model_inspect`, `module_inspect`, `entity_lookup`, `validate_domain`, `validate_depends`, `validate_relation`, `describe_module`, `check_module_exists`, `resolve_orm_chain`. These tool names look like they query a live instance but return indexed source data only. If you need live records, Odoo Semantic is the wrong server.

**Session bootstrap** (call once at session start):
- `set_active_version(odoo_version='17.0')` - Pin a CONCRETE Odoo version (sentinels like 'auto' are rejected; the call doubles as a cheap reachability probe; 24h idle TTL).

**Primary tools:**
- `model_inspect` ★ - Superset inspection of an ORM model: enumerate or fully describe fields, methods, views, extenders, or a summary in one call.
- `entity_lookup` ★ - Single-entity drill-down by kind discriminator: model, field, method, view, module, pattern, or report - with full inheritance chain and source module.
- `find_override_point` - Show override chain, super() safety guidance, and anti-patterns for a method to find the safest place to inject custom behavior.
- `impact_analysis` - Risk assessment of changing or removing a field, method, or model: blast radius, dependent modules, and downstream fields.
- `suggest_pattern` - Find curated Odoo design patterns from the catalogue with gotchas and anti-patterns.
- `find_examples` - Semantic code search returning real indexed code snippets from the Odoo codebase.
- `resolve_orm_chain` ⊕ - Walk a dotted ORM field path hop by hop to the terminal field type or the exact hop where it breaks.
- `validate_depends` ⊕ - Validate compute method's `@api.depends('a.b', ...)` paths; flag `id` and suggest typos.
- `validate_domain` ⊕ - Validate search domain terms: field-path resolution and operator version-awareness.
- `validate_relation` ⊕ - Assert a relational field points at the expected comodel (many2one/one2many/many2many).
- `lookup_core_api` - Verify Odoo core API symbol signature, status (stable/deprecated/removed), and replacement.
- `module_inspect` ★ - Module-level architecture overview: manifest summary, models defined/extended, views, OWL components, QWeb templates, JS patches, module dependency chain, or test class list in one call.
- `check_module_exists` - Verify module availability, edition (CE/EE/Viindoo), and cross-version presence.
- `api_version_diff` - Structured diff of an API symbol or scope across two Odoo versions: new, changed, removed, deprecated items.
- `profile_inspect` - Profile-level introspection discriminator (ADR-0028): inspect a tenant profile's composition in one call.
- `find_test_examples` - Semantic search for Odoo test code examples (test_method, test_class, js_test chunks only - never returns production code).
- `test_base_classes` - Menu of official Odoo test framework base classes (TransactionCase, HttpCase, SavepointCase, Form, etc.) for the given version, with test_type and cursor contract.
- `test_coverage_audit` - Audit an entire module for test coverage gaps: lists fields/methods with zero COVERS_* edges (never referenced by any test).
- `tests_covering` - List test methods that have COVERS_MODEL/COVERS_FIELD/COVERS_METHOD edges to the target model or field (static reference coverage, not runtime executed coverage).

## Brief context

The design doc is a **contract for the coders**. Eight fixed sections (Intent & Business Value,
Approach, Data model, Override strategy, Module structure, Sequencing, Test strategy outline, Risks)
are specified in `agents/odoo-solution-architect.md` (Round 4 is the SSOT for the doc template).

For full-stack design, ground the frontend approach in the **fidelity** contract
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/odoo-frontend-fidelity.md`. Full reference (doc structure,
frontend-design sources, key failure modes prevented):
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/odoo-solution-design/references/brief-context.md`

### Test strategy grounding (§7) - when to use which test tool

Section §7 "Test strategy outline" is the highest-leverage output of the TDD: every downstream
agent (odoo-test-writing, odoo-qa-planner, odoo-coder) inherits the base classes and behavior list
it specifies (odoo-qa-planner turns it into the independent acceptance oracle under odoo-acceptance;
odoo-qa-suite reuses it only as a static release test-plan, never to execute or adjudicate). The architect uses four test tools - already visible in `## MCP tools` below - at
specific moments in the design rounds:

| Tool | When in the rounds | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `test_base_classes(odoo_version='<version>')` | Round 0 HARD RULE, before writing any test class name | Returns authoritative `TransactionCase` / `HttpCase` / `SavepointCase` / `Form` menu for the pinned version + always outputs **`cr.commit()` FORBIDDEN** contract. Never assert a base class from memory. |
| `find_test_examples(query='<feature>', odoo_version='<version>')` | Round 1, call #5, parallel with `find_examples` | Returns ONLY test chunks (no production code). Seeds the workflow-path shapes that populate §7 rows. Use instead of `find_examples` whenever the intent is to find test patterns. |
| `tests_covering(model='<model>', odoo_version='<version>')` | Round 2, immediately after `impact_analysis` | Lists test methods that already COVER the target model/field/method. Zero model-level edges = unguarded behavior that §7 must add. Non-zero = existing protection (no need to duplicate). Edge count goes in the Impact matrix and §7 "Already covered?" column. **Caveat:** method-narrow (`method=`) and field-narrow (`field=`) calls frequently return zero edges even for well-tested code because COVERS_METHOD / COVERS_FIELD edges are sparse; prefer the model-level call as the primary signal and treat method-narrow zero as supporting evidence only. |
| `test_coverage_audit(module='<module>', odoo_version='<version>')` | Round 4, first step before filling §7 rows | Audits the whole module for zero-coverage fields (field-level static-reference; method gaps are NOT reported - use `tests_covering` with `method=` to probe a specific method, but expect sparse results). Each field gap surfaced here that the design introduces or modifies MUST appear as a new test row in §7. |

**Invariant:** §7 is only valid if all four tools were called during the design rounds AND - when
the design covers more than one module - the table is PARTITIONED PER MODULE (a `### <module>`
subheading per row of §1's per-module table, mandatory even in single-mode multi-module TDDs). A §7
written from memory (no `test_base_classes` call) or pooled across modules with no per-module
partition is a design defect - the wrong base class or an unowned behavior row in the TDD flows
verbatim into test code.

## Agent invocation - prompt template (P1)

When composing the dispatch prompt for any specialist agent you dispatch, fill the caller-side
skeleton in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/dispatch-brief.md` (read it by path) plus the target
agent's family delta; never inline that file verbatim into a hard-leaf brief.

Launch `odoo-solution-architect` as a subagent (single mode, or after the scope question resolved).
Use the template below **verbatim**, filling the bracketed placeholders.

**Model per dispatch** - set as the subagent `model` parameter (the `DISPATCH MODEL` line
records the tier chosen; both must match):
- **opus** - default for every design.
- **fable** - ONLY for Custom-XL tier or a design spanning >=3 modules full-stack with a new
  inheritance axis. Requires explicit human confirmation (state tier, cost, and why). If
  declined or unavailable, fall back to **opus** and note in the TDD header
  (`dispatch: opus (fable declined/unavailable)`).

```
DISPATCH MODEL: <opus|fable>
You are the odoo-solution-architect agent. Produce an Odoo Technical Design Document (NOT
production code) for the following change:

REQUEST: [full requirement/goal, with target model(s), Odoo version, any constraints. For the
classification/effort tier, prefer the GAP_MATRIX file below over a pasted tier string - the
architect reads it per requirement]

GAP_MATRIX: [omit this line entirely when absent; otherwise the gap artifact path found by the
Input port - <SHARE_DIR>/gap-analysis/<slug>-<date>/gap-matrix.jsonl, or the BRL results dir
<SHARE_DIR>/brl/<job-id>/. The architect READS this for the authoritative per-requirement
classification/effort_tier - do NOT also flatten the tier into REQUEST as free text]

RETURN_TO: [omit this line entirely when absent; set to the caller skill name (e.g.
odoo-forward-port) when the caller requests return routing after design approval]

DESIGN_SLUG_HINT: [omit when absent; short slug the caller wants used for the design doc
filename, e.g. account-move-fp-18 - the architect uses this as the <slug> when writing
<SHARE_DIR>/designs/<slug>-<date>.md]

Step 0 (ONLY if mcp__odoo-semantic__* tools are available): call
set_active_version('<version>'), then proceed through your design rounds. If OSM is
unavailable, use the Standalone-first fallback (disk-grounded: Read/Grep the repo). If OSM
is reachable but a SPECIFIC module/model in this request is not in the index (a
customer-local custom module), that is a Tier-1 MISS, not proof of absence: keep OSM for
everything it covers and Read/Grep the local addons for just the missed entities, grounding
the design hybrid (grounded: osm + local-source (hybrid)). Do NOT
design from memory when OSM is reachable.

Follow your system-prompt rounds. Write the design doc to <SHARE_DIR>/designs/<slug>-<date>.md.
Do NOT write any production source files - the design doc is your only artifact.
GROUNDING you were not handed is yours to source: when a fact the design turns on is missing
(no gap matrix for an uncosted requirement list, an unknown current behavior, a bounded
external question), invoke the skill that owns it or launch a read-only research worker per
your system prompt's § Delegating for grounding, rather than designing against a guess or
bouncing back for it. Dispatch is asynchronous: save the doc, dispatch, end your turn.
```

The agent inherits the FULL tool surface (it carries no `tools:` allowlist) and stays read-only
on SOURCE: it never writes production code, and the TDD is always its own work. It MAY invoke
a grounding skill or launch a read-only analysis/research worker to close a fact gap - that is
a sanctioned nested spawn, and `agents/odoo-solution-architect.md` § Delegating for grounding
is the SSOT for which skills are in bounds, the fan-out cap, and the dispatch physics.

### Payload mapping when `return_to` is set (caller-return flow)

When a caller (e.g. `odoo-forward-port`) supplies `return_to`, map its payload
(`target_version` / `modules` / `classification` / `intent_records` / `design_slug_hint` /
`return_to` / `design_proposals`) onto the P1 architect dispatch template per the field-by-field table in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/odoo-solution-design/references/return-to-payload.md` - do NOT
improvise or drop a field, and never flatten `intent_records` into the classification summary
(it carries the behavioral contract the design must honour, distinct from the structural
classification). Every `design_proposals` entry MUST come back adjudicated - the returned
`design_doc` carries one `adopted`/`rejected` verdict per entry, because the caller applies such a
change only on `adopted`; an unanswered proposal silently becomes "never happens". The default (no
`return_to`) path skips this entirely.

## Standalone-first fallback

When OSM is unreachable: architect `Read`/`Grep`s module source (field lists, method signatures,
manifest `depends`), labels doc `grounded: local-source (not OSM-indexed)`. When OSM is
reachable but a specific module is not in the index (customer-local addon): OSM for what it
covers, local source for missed entities, doc labeled `grounded: osm + local-source (hybrid)`.
Only when the repo itself is inaccessible: fall back to memory, label `OSM unavailable -
ungrounded`. Three-tier grounding SSOT: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/disk-fallback-protocol.md`.
Escalate (`NEEDS_CONTEXT`) only for business decisions no source encodes - never to ask a human
to paste code or manifests.

## Agent-managed tools

This skill is part of an agent+skill bundle. See `agents/odoo-solution-architect.md` for the
full restricted (read-only) tool list and execution detail.

## Design-approval gate (who approves: the human)

When the architect returns the TDD, **do NOT auto-chain to coding.** Present a tight summary
(chosen approach + rationale, data-model/override headlines, top risk, pointer to the full doc),
then gate. Write the gate message in the USER'S LANGUAGE (translate labels and prose; keep file
paths, module names, and model identifiers verbatim):

```
Design ready: <SHARE_DIR>/designs/<slug>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md

Approve design? (approve / refine: [feedback] / cancel)
```

- `refine: [feedback]` → re-dispatch the architect with the feedback; rewrite the same doc.
- `approve` → ONLY NOW does the chain move on. Two branches:
  - **`return_to` is UNSET (default standalone flow):** hand off to `odoo-planning` to turn the
    approved design into the execution plan (module order + integration cadence + lifecycle
    wiring); `odoo-planning` owns the code Plan Mode and the plan wires `odoo-coding` (each coding
    node landed by `run-harness`) per its plan. (Migration carve-out: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/planning-gate-contract.md` § Migration carve-out - single-module scripts only; THIS skill owns that front-door routing decision, no executor re-validates it.)
  - **`return_to` is SET (caller-return flow):** do NOT enter a code Plan Mode and do NOT
    dispatch any coder. Emit the Continuation Contract (see below) with `next: <return_to>`
    and hand control back to the caller. The caller (e.g. `odoo-forward-port`) owns the
    downstream Plan Mode and code dispatch.
- `cancel` → stop; the design doc remains on disk for later.

Optional assist (does not replace human approval): for an independent opinion on DESIGN
SOUNDNESS (not code-vs-design conformance), dispatch `odoo-solution-architect MODE: review` (see
the Decompose branch's `review-master` / `review-children` gate keywords for master-child mode;
for single mode, invoke it directly on the design doc) - a fresh-spawn adversarial pass that never
authored this design. Do NOT use `odoo-code-review` for this: it checks that CODE conforms to the
approved design, not whether the design itself is sound. The human still makes the approval call
either way.

## Continuation Contract

When the bundle finishes, append a Continuation Contract block per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/continuation-contract.md` (status / produced / next). The `next`
is **gated on the human design-approval above** - the driver dispatches the next step only after
the design is approved. Choose `next` as follows:

- **`return_to` is SET:** emit `next: <return_to>` (e.g. `next: odoo-forward-port`). Include
  in `inputs`: `design_doc: <path>` only. Do NOT emit a coder target. The caller recovers
  everything else (module names, branches, versions) from its own checkpoint; only the design
  doc path needs to cross the boundary. The caller resumes with the approved design doc and
  runs its own Plan Mode.
- **`return_to` is UNSET (default):** for a backend, frontend, or full-stack design emit
  `next: odoo-planning` (the planner turns the approved design into the execution
  plan before any code is written); for a migration design that meets the Migration carve-out
  (single-module script, single `dag_layer`) emit `next: odoo-data-migration` (or `odoo-coding`)
  directly - a front-door routing decision THIS skill owns, per
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/planning-gate-contract.md` § Migration carve-out (no executor
  re-validates on arrival); any richer (multi-module/multi-layer) design goes through `odoo-planning`.
  Each carries `design_doc: <path>` so the next step builds on the approved design.

- **Master-child mode (`approve-master-child` path):** see Decompose branch § f above. Emit
  `design_index` / `master_design_doc` / `design_docs` - NOT bare `design_doc:` (single-mode only).

Additive output for the run-harness - it does not change anything produced above.
