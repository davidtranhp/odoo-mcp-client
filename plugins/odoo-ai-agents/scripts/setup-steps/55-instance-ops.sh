# 55-instance-ops.sh - Mechanical runner for Odoo module operations and tests.
#
# This script is the EXECUTION layer: it receives fully-resolved flags from its
# caller (the odoo-instance-ops agent, which resolves per-version flags via OSM
# cli_help) and runs the appropriate odoo-bin command with a persistent log.
#
# It does NOT resolve version-specific flags; those arrive pre-resolved via
# --extra. It does NOT read instances.toml; all connection parameters are
# passed explicitly.
#
# Subcommands:
#   describe  - one-line purpose (step-script contract)
#   check     - lightweight; always exits 0 (on-demand ops script, not installer)
#   apply     - alias for init (for step-runner compat; same args as init)
#   init    --db <db> --python <venv_py> --addons <path> --modules <a,b>
#             [--version <X.Y>] [--extra "<resolved flags>"]
#             Run: $python $odoo_bin -d <db> -i <modules> --addons-path <addons>
#                  --unaccent --stop-after-init --log-level=info
#                  --log-handler=<ns>.modules.loading:INFO <extra>
#             Persistent log + LOG_PATH= + STATUS= lines.
#
#             Deterministic completion contract (never a log-tail wait - see
#             docs/reference/INSTANCE-LIFECYCLE-BUILD-CONTRACT.md item 14): the process ALWAYS
#             runs with --stop-after-init, so completion is PROCESS EXIT, bounded
#             by nothing more than the caller's own foreground timeout. --version
#             resolves <ns> = 'openerp' for series < 10 (v8-v9), else 'odoo' (v10+;
#             also the default when --version is omitted) - the namespace Odoo's
#             module-loading logger lives under changed at the v9->v10 rename. The
#             --log-handler flag is a FLOOR, not a workaround: it keeps the
#             "Modules loaded." completion line on the log at ANY level a
#             caller may pass in <extra>, including a quieter one.
#             SUCCESS = exit code 0 AND the "Modules loaded." marker is present AND
#             NONE of these failure markers appear: CRITICAL, Traceback (most
#             recent call last), invalid module names, ignored, Some modules are
#             not loaded, Unmet dependenc(y|ies), cannot be installed. Exit 0 ALONE
#             is NOT proof of install - three source-confirmed SILENT-skip paths
#             stay exit 0: a misspelled/nonexistent module name, an unresolved
#             dependency, and a demo-data failure downgraded to a warning. FAILURE
#             (non-zero exit, OR any failure marker, OR a missing "Modules
#             loaded." marker) -> non-zero return with the log path preserved for
#             diagnosis; this verb NEVER blocks on reading a log line to decide
#             completion, only on the process actually exiting. The launch is
#             ALSO wrapped in a `ulimit -Sv`+`--limit-memory-hard=` resource-limit
#             guard (see below and snippets/odoo-bin-resource-limits.md).
#   update  --db <db> --python <venv_py> --addons <path> --modules <a,b>
#             [--version <X.Y>] [--extra "<resolved flags>"]
#             Same as init but with -u instead of -i; identical completion contract.
#   test    --db <db> --python <venv_py> --addons <path> --modules <a,b>
#             [--test-tags <tags>] [--mode fresh|reuse] [--log-mode info|debug|sql]
#             [--version <X.Y>] [--extra "<resolved flags>"]
#             Run with <-i|-u> <modules> --test-enable [--test-tags <tags>]
#             --stop-after-init. --test-tags is the SELECTION side of the run's
#             scope: <-i|-u> decides which modules the registry BUILDS, --test-tags
#             decides whose tests RUN. Omitted, odoo-bin runs every module the
#             registry loaded - the whole dependency + auto_install closure from
#             `base` up, not the ones named in --modules. This script does not
#             invent a filter (it receives fully-resolved flags); the CALLER
#             resolves the tags, and TEST_TAGS_USED= reports what it passed so a
#             forgotten filter is visible in the summary rather than silent.
#             Scope contract: snippets/test-scope-contract.md. --mode fresh (default) -> -i (new DB / modules not yet
#             installed; init+test in one pass); --mode reuse -> -u (DB already has the
#             modules; re-running tests, where -i would be a no-op). --log-mode maps to
#             the odoo log flag (debug -> --log-level=debug, sql -> --log-handler=
#             odoo.sql_db:DEBUG); omitted keeps the shared $_DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL default.
#             `warn` is REFUSED (exit 2): it suppresses the pass summary, so every
#             green run under it would parse as inconclusive.
#             Parses result and emits TEST_RESULT=passed|failed|inconclusive plus the
#             TEST_FAILED/TEST_ERROR/TEST_WARNING/TEST_SKIPPED counts, the
#             JS_RUNS/JS_SCOPE/JS_FAILED_REPORTED/JS_FAILED_TESTS counts, and
#             FINDINGS_PATH (a file naming the failing tests it could resolve -
#             Python markers with traceback heads, JS failures per run - plus the
#             warning lines and any skipped-test names). A --test-enable build runs
#             TWO test frameworks that publish two unrelated vocabularies, so the
#             Python figures are never the run's whole failure count and the JS
#             figures are never the Python one: read both. The counts and the
#             findings file are resolved to AGREE with the verdict: a run whose only
#             failure signal is an AGGREGATE line (the per-module "Module <m>: <F>
#             failures, <E> errors[ of <T> tests]" wording, or v14+'s per-database
#             "<F> failed, <E> error(s) of <T> tests") reports THAT line's
#             figures, and the findings file names the line rather than answering
#             "no failing tests" for a failed build. TEST_FAILED/TEST_ERROR are
#             EMPTY when the log published no figure at all (e.g. the numberless
#             "At least one test failed when loading the modules.") - unmeasured,
#             never 0, the same rule the JS and scope fields below follow.
#             TEST_RESULT=failed also covers an
#             INSTALL failure inside the build (no test could run). inconclusive fires
#             when TEST_SKIPPED>0 and no failure occurred, AND whenever the log carries
#             no era-correct "the suite ran" marker at all: "0 failed, 0 error(s) of 1
#             tests" can mean the sole test was SKIPPED (never ran), and an exit-0 run
#             whose tag filter matched nothing produces no marker at all - a bare
#             TEST_RESULT=passed would falsely certify both. Skips are NOT fatal
#             (legitimate via @tagged filters or missing external deps): they are
#             reported, never swallowed into an unqualified pass, and never force a
#             non-zero exit on their own. --version picks the era-correct marker
#             (v8-v13 "Ran <N> tests in <X>s" vs v14+ "<F> failed, <E> error(s) of <T>
#             tests"); omitted, EITHER wording is accepted.
#             Also emits MODULES_LOADED=<n> and TESTS_RUN=<n> - the SCOPE the run
#             actually covered, as machine output rather than something a caller
#             has to grep for and retype. EMPTY means the log carried no such
#             marker (unmeasured), never 0. The whole summary block is ALSO
#             appended to the log, so `wait-log` can surface the verdict.
#   drop    --db <db> --python <venv_py> [--db-host H] [--db-user U] [--db-port P]
#             [--odoo-root R] [--run-id ID] [--force]
#             Invoke scripts/lib/odoo_db.py drop <db> via the instance venv python.
#             --db-port threads to odoo_db.py when non-empty (empty -> omit).
#             --odoo-root threads the instance's declared odoo_root the same way:
#             a source checkout needs it for `import odoo` to resolve at all.
#             Unless --force is given, always calls allocator.py assert-droppable first
#             (with whatever --run-id value the caller has, including an empty one for a
#             standalone/one-off caller) and refuses a fresh foreign lease (route via
#             release); --force overrides.
#             Exit 10 from odoo_db.py -> clear venv-unavailable error (NOT a raw dropdb).
#
# init/update/test also accept [--db-host H] [--db-user U] [--db-port P] so the
# CREATE/INIT/UPDATE/TEST connection matches the DROP connection (one declared
# port honored everywhere). All three run TWO preflights BEFORE any real run and
# BEFORE any log is opened, so a refusal costs no log file and no odoo-bin:
#   1. `<python> <odoo-bin> --version` - fail loud (no working venv; run 45-venv.sh).
#   2. `odoo_db.py preflight` - PROVE Odoo can authenticate to the cluster. Odoo
#      opens its maintenance-database connection for every `-d <name>` run before
#      any module loads, so a refused connection kills update and test exactly as
#      it kills a create. Exits 8 (authentication refused) / 9 (cluster did not
#      answer) with odoo_db.py's own refusal text forwarded verbatim; an
#      UNDETERMINABLE state never blocks.
#
# RESOURCE LIMITS (init/update/test only - Problem 1 hardening): the odoo-bin
# launch runs in a scoped subshell `( ulimit -Sv <kib> ...; <odoo-bin cmd> ...
# --limit-memory-hard=<bytes> ... ${arg_extra} )` - both driven by
# scripts/lib/resource_limits.sh, overridable via ODOO_AI_LIMIT_MEMORY_HARD.
# Full policy (why both mechanisms, the v12.0 enforcement boundary, the
# uncapped escape hatch): snippets/odoo-bin-resource-limits.md.
#   wait-log --log <logf> [--timeout <secs>] [--interval <secs>]
#             Blocks in the FOREGROUND until a terminal marker appears or the
#             bound elapses, then prints
#             BUILD_RESULT=success|failure|inconclusive|timeout.
#             The DEFAULT bound is deliberately below the harness's per-call
#             ceiling (see _WAIT_LOG_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_S) so ONE call always
#             returns a verdict; for a longer build, re-invoke it.
#             Deterministic build-completion detector for a build launched in the
#             BACKGROUND (Bash run_in_background). Polls <logf> for a TERMINAL marker
#             so the caller (odoo-instance-ops agent) never idle-stalls on a long
#             -i/-u/--test-enable build that would exceed the foreground tool timeout.
#             Emits BUILD_RESULT plus BUILD_MARKER=<line>,
#             BUILD_PROGRESS=<reading> and LOG_PATH=<logf>. Exit 0 (success),
#             1 (failure), 2 (timeout), 3 (inconclusive). Only exit 2 means
#             "keep waiting"; 0, 1 and 3 are all FINISHED, and only 0 is a pass.
#             The build's
#             own exit code stays authoritative; this is a completion + diagnostics
#             signal, NOT the running-server readiness probe (that is 50-instance-spinup.sh's
#             HTTP-200 probe). Markers are version-stable v8-v19.
#             BUILD_PROGRESS is the ADVANCING field, emitted on EVERY path so a
#             caller can diff two consecutive polls. It is ONE COMPOSITE reading,
#             `markers:<n>|bytes:<m>`, with BOTH components always present:
#             `markers` counts the run's own progress lines (SSOT:
#             _BUILD_PROGRESS_RE) and `bytes` is the log's length. Compare the
#             WHOLE string - either half alone freezes on a healthy run (markers
#             through a browser suite that is one long test; bytes never, unless
#             the process wrote nothing). EMPTY means there is no log to measure.
#             It NEVER feeds BUILD_RESULT: progress is not a verdict in either
#             direction, and a build whose log carries nothing but progress lines
#             stays BUILD_RESULT=timeout. Two polls with an IDENTICAL non-empty
#             reading mean the process appended zero bytes in between - the
#             strongest in-log stall evidence available, still not proof of death;
#             BUILD_MARKER quotes the newest progress line so the reading has a
#             human-readable form, but the composite is what a stall rule
#             compares.
#             The terminal predicate is resolved from the log's OWN run-verb stamp
#             (_RUN_VERB_STAMP, written by _open_log). An UNSTAMPED log resolves
#             to the `test` predicate - the NARROWER one in both directions, so an
#             unknown verb can never be certified green by a marker that is only
#             progress for it, nor failed by one that is only per-test evidence:
#               init/update - "Modules loaded." plus _INSTALL_FAIL_RE, the SAME two
#                 SSOT constants _install_confirmed applies and nothing besides, so
#                 this background verdict can NEVER disagree with the script's own
#                 STATUS=ok|error line; a log showing both "Modules loaded." and a
#                 silent-skip marker (e.g. "invalid module names, ignored") reports
#                 BUILD_RESULT=failure, never success.
#               test - the run's own TEST_RESULT= line (appended to the log by the
#                 `test` verb, echoed back here, and the ONLY line on a test log
#                 computed AFTER the run exited) decides it, value by value:
#                 passed -> success, failed -> failure, inconclusive ->
#                 inconclusive, anything unrecognized -> failure. Each value has
#                 its own arm and NONE falls through to success: the run emits
#                 `inconclusive` exactly when it refuses to claim a pass without
#                 positive proof the suite ran, so relaying that as a successful
#                 build would tell a caller the tests passed when zero tests ran.
#                 Before that line lands, ONLY a
#                 HARD ABORT (_BUILD_ABORT_RE - the run died and will never
#                 publish a verdict) is a failure, and the era-correct "the suite
#                 ran" marker certifies success ONLY while neither a failure
#                 marker nor a SKIP marker contradicts it. A per-test FAIL:/ERROR:, its traceback, and the
#                 per-MODULE failure aggregate are all MID-RUN and report
#                 BUILD_RESULT=timeout: the suite keeps running, so preempting the
#                 run's own verdict there both stops the wait early and hands the
#                 caller a verdict the run never published. "Modules loaded." is
#                 only PROGRESS for a test run: Odoo logs it before the
#                 post-install suite starts, so certifying there would stop the
#                 wait while the tests have not begun. BUILD_RESULT answers "has it
#                 finished"; TEST_RESULT (echoed when the log carries it) is the
#                 pass/fail verdict.
#             NEVER key a marker scan on the log-LEVEL column: Odoo logs at ERROR
#             for reasons unrelated to the build, so a delimited ` ERROR ` match
#             fires on lines that carry no verdict (measured: 30 ERROR-level lines
#             / 1 test-failure marker on one real run). Key on MESSAGE TEXT.
#
# LOG convention (mirrors 50-instance-spinup.sh):
#   Dir:  ${ODOO_AI_HOME:-$HOME/.odoo-ai}/logs/
#     ODOO_AI_HOME IS the .odoo-ai dir (allocator semantic); .odoo-ai is appended
#     ONLY in the HOME fallback so the path is consistent with allocator.py _home().
#   File: <db>-<UTC-ts>.log  (e.g. mydb-20260620T153012Z.log)
#   Line: LOG_PATH=<absolute-path>   (parseable; one per operation)
#   The log's FIRST line is the run-verb stamp (_RUN_VERB_STAMP=<verb> SERIES=<X.Y>),
#   which is what lets `wait-log` pick the era- and verb-correct terminal predicate
#   from the log alone. Every writer APPENDS after that line.
#
# STATUS line:  STATUS=ok|error        (parseable; always emitted)
# TEST_RESULT:  TEST_RESULT=passed|failed|inconclusive  (parseable; only for `test` verb;
#               failed means a non-zero exit, a test-failure marker, or an install
#               failure; inconclusive means TEST_SKIPPED>0 with no failure, or no
#               era-correct "the suite ran" marker at all - tests were never proven to
#               have run; NEVER reported as a bare `passed`)
# TEST counts:  TEST_FAILED=<n> TEST_ERROR=<n> TEST_WARNING=<n> TEST_SKIPPED=<n>
#               (parseable; `test` verb only; from the log). TEST_FAILED/TEST_ERROR
#               count PYTHON unittest cases only - the browser suite has its own
#               vocabulary and its own fields below; neither set is a subset of the
#               other, so neither figure may be read as the run's whole failure
#               count. They are EMPTY when the log published no figure at all -
#               unmeasured, never 0, so they can never read `0` beside a `failed`
#               verdict)
# JS counts:    JS_RUNS=<n> JS_SCOPE=scoped|unscoped
#               JS_FAILED_REPORTED=<n> JS_FAILED_TESTS=<n>
#               (parseable; `test` verb only; the Hoot/QUnit half). A RUN is one
#               browser-suite logger scope, not the file - one log holds several.
#               JS_FAILED_REPORTED sums each run's OWN published figure (QUnit
#               publishes failed ASSERTIONS, Hoot failed TESTS - mixed units, as
#               reported); JS_FAILED_TESTS counts distinct failing test NAMES.
#               Neither derives from the other. JS_SCOPE=unscoped means the log
#               published only an aggregate with no logger prefix, so
#               JS_FAILED_TESTS is unavailable. All four EMPTY together when the
#               log carries no JS marker - unmeasured, never 0)
# TEST scope:   MODULES_LOADED=<n> TESTS_RUN=<n>  (parseable; `test` verb only;

# _preflight_db_auth - PROVE Odoo can authenticate BEFORE anything is launched.
#   Odoo's CLI opens a connection to the maintenance database for EVERY `-d
#   <name>` run, before any registry and before any module loads. A cluster that
#   refuses that connection therefore kills init, update and test alike - not
#   only a create - and it does so mid-build, with a raw traceback and a log that
#   documents nothing. So this runs BEFORE _open_log: on a refusal no log is
#   opened and no odoo-bin is launched.
#   The verdict and its remedy text are OWNED by odoo_db.py preflight. This
#   function forwards the child's stderr verbatim and exits with the child's own
#   code (8 denied, 9 unreachable, 1 undeterminable) - it never re-words a
#   diagnosis, because a second copy of a verdict is how two layers came to
#   contradict each other.
#   Uses the flags this script was GIVEN: it deliberately reads no catalog.
#   BOUNDED (pg_bounded_run): it runs BEFORE _open_log, so an unbounded hang here
#   emits no LOG_PATH= at all and the caller's own `wait-log --timeout` has nothing
#   to bind to - one silent forever-stall instead of a logged failure. psycopg2
#   opens the connection with no libpq connect timeout, so a host that silently

# Completion-marker SSOT - ONE definition per fact, read by EVERY verdict path
#   in this script: _install_confirmed (foreground init/update verdict),
#   _parse_test_result (foreground test verdict) and _scan_build_markers
#   (background wait-log verdict). Two paths holding their own copy of "what
#   counts as failure" is what let them answer opposite things about the same
#   log, so a new marker is added HERE ONLY and every call site picks it up.
#
#   NEVER key any of these on the log-LEVEL column. Odoo logs at ERROR for
#   reasons that have nothing to do with the build (a scheduled job raising, a
#   mail send, a deprecated call), so a delimited ` ERROR ` match fires on
#   lines that carry no verdict at all. MEASURED on two real run logs: an 18.0
#   run held 30 ERROR-level lines of which 1 was a test-failure marker, and a
#   19.0 run held 100 of which 98 were - the level column predicts nothing.
#   Every scan below keys on MESSAGE TEXT, the same rule the ` INFO ` /
#   `RUNBOT` level drift already forces.
#
#   _BUILD_ABORT_RE - the run DIED or was never able to start: after any of
#     these it will never publish a verdict of its own, so waiting for one is a
#     guaranteed stall and they are TERMINAL for every verb, tests included.
#     odoo-bin's preload_registries wraps ANY load-time exception in a CRITICAL
#     line, so a broken XML data file or a refused Postgres connection during a
#     --test-enable build lands here through CRITICAL.
#   _PER_TEST_TRACEBACK_RE - a failure signal ONLY for a build that runs no
#     tests, and it is in _INSTALL_FAIL_RE for exactly that reason. Under -i/-u
#     nothing but the build itself can raise, so a traceback there IS the
#     failure. On a --test-enable run it is NOT: odoo/tests/result.py logError()
#     logs "<FAIL|ERROR>: <test>" followed by
#     traceback.TracebackException.format(), so every failing test writes one -
#     every failing PYTHON test, that is; a Hoot/QUnit failure writes none -
#     but so does any logged exception the run recovers from, ir_http's routing
#     errors, sql_db, and every HttpCase 500 the test asserts on. MEASURED
#     across every real run log on disk: the traceback count matches the
#     FAIL:/ERROR: marker count in only three quarters of them, and the
#     divergence is large and one-directional (96 tracebacks against 4 markers;
#     13 against 3; 12 against 9; 17 against 16), including a run with one
#     traceback and no failure marker at all whose own summary reported nothing
#     failed. So on a test run it is per-test/incidental evidence, never a
#     verdict - ruling on it is the same false-RED bug as keying on the level
#     column. EVERY test-verb path below therefore rules on
#     _TEST_FAIL_RE|_BUILD_ABORT_RE and never on _INSTALL_FAIL_RE; a genuinely
#     failing test is still caught because result.py logs its FAIL:/ERROR:
#     marker BEFORE the traceback, so the marker set loses nothing - the set
#     being _TEST_FAIL_RE, which carries the Hoot/QUnit vocabulary too, not the
#     Python pair alone.
#   _INSTALL_SUCCESS_MARKER - the completion line kept on the log by
#     --log-handler=<ns>.modules.loading:INFO, a floor that survives any
#     caller-supplied level.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
_BUILD_ABORT_RE='CRITICAL|invalid module names, ignored|Some modules are not loaded|Unmet dependenc|cannot be installed|Failed to load registry|psycopg2\.|ParseError'
_PER_TEST_TRACEBACK_RE='Traceback \(most recent call last\)'
_INSTALL_FAIL_RE="${_BUILD_ABORT_RE}|${_PER_TEST_TRACEBACK_RE}"
_INSTALL_SUCCESS_MARKER='Modules loaded.'

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Log-level SSOT - the ONE default every verb passes to odoo-bin. `info` is
# Odoo's own default and a valid --log-level token on every series v8-v19,
# and it is the LOWEST level at which a PASSING test run still emits its own
# summary line: below it a green run is byte-identical to "no tests ran".
# Every setter below reads THIS constant - never a second literal. A caller
# overrides per run with their own --log-level in --extra, which is placed
# AFTER this default (Odoo's parser takes the last occurrence).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
_DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL='info'

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# JS test-outcome marker SSOT - the SECOND per-test vocabulary. A --test-enable
#   build runs Python unittest AND a browser JS suite, and the two publish
#   COMPLETELY DIFFERENT wordings. The Python set below matches none of these:
#   the numeric catch-all `[1-9][0-9]* (failed|error)` fails on
#   `1876 / 34338 tests failed` (a word sits between the digit and `failed`) and
#   on `ended (passed: 5530 / failed: 481)` (a colon does). Without this block a
#   JS run's failures are represented by the ONE `FAIL:` line the Python wrapper
#   method raises, whatever the true magnitude.
#
#   THE RUN BOUNDARY IS THE LOGGER SCOPE, NOT THE FILE. One log file holds
#   SEVERAL JS runs: Odoo logs each browser suite under its own
#   `<ns>.addons.<module>.tests.test_js.<Suite>[.<method>].browser` logger, and
#   one `test` verb can drive several. Every figure below is therefore read PER
#   SCOPE and summed; de-duplicating across the whole file merges runs that
#   share test names and destroys real failures.
#
#   _JS_SCOPE_RE - the run boundary AND the echo filter. Odoo prints the failing
#     `browser_js(...)` SOURCE LINE inside its traceback, so the log contains
#     `success_signal="[HOOT] Test suite succeeded"` verbatim in runs that
#     FAILED. That echo carries no logger prefix; a real marker always does,
#     and the prefix it carries is what binds it to one run - every marker
#     below is read per scope only.
#     The suite/method segment is deliberately unconstrained: the wrapper method
#     is renamed three times across the supported series (`test_01_js`/
#     `test_02_js` at v11-v12, `test_js` at v13-v17, `test_unit_desktop`/
#     `test_hoot`/`test_qunit_desktop` at v18-v19 - read from
#     web/tests/test_js.py per series), so keying on it would gate the counter
#     to one era.
#   _JS_HOOT_TEST_FAIL_RE - ONE failing Hoot test. Unit: TESTS.
#   _JS_HOOT_SUITE_END_RE / _JS_HOOT_SUITE_FAILED_RE - a Hoot suite's own
#     trailer. A suite name with no `/` is a ROOT suite; roots are disjoint by
#     construction (nesting is a tree), so summing the roots' failed values
#     cannot double count while summing every `ended` line would. A fully green
#     suite omits the `/ failed:` half entirely, which is why the two forms are
#     separate: the shorter one still proves a JS run happened.
#   _JS_QUNIT_TEST_FAIL_RE - ONE failing QUnit test line. Echoed within its own
#     scope, and also re-printed with no scope at all, so it is used for NAMES
#     (de-duplicated) and never as a count.
#   _JS_QUNIT_AGG_RE - QUnit's own published aggregate. Unit: failed
#     ASSERTIONS, not tests - 4 distinct failing tests report `8 / 422`
#     (measured on the real corpus). It is the only figure a QUnit run publishes
#     for itself and it is NOT derivable from the test names, which is why both
#     quantities are emitted under separate names rather than reconciled.
#   _JS_GREEN_RE - the positive markers. Scope-anchored like every other one: a
#     green marker is a verdict for ITS OWN SCOPE ONLY. A log can carry a
#     genuine `[HOOT] Test suite succeeded` for one run and hundreds of failures
#     in another run of the SAME file.
#   _JS_FAIL_RE - "some JS test failed". Joined into _TEST_FAIL_RE below so a
#     JS-only failure can never be certified green if Odoo ever stops raising in
#     the Python wrapper. The aggregate alternative requires a NON-ZERO count
#     here; the count-parsing form allows zero.
#   _JS_MARKER_RE - "this log contains a JS run at all", failing or green. The
#     union is what makes EMPTY (unmeasured) distinguishable from a measured 0.
#
#   Marker WORDING is corpus-verified on 17.0 / 18.0 / 19.0 only (the run logs
#   that exist). For 11.0-16.0 OSM grounds the FRAMEWORK (QUnit only, no Hoot
#   suite indexed before 18.0) and the wrapper method names, but not the browser
#   console wording - so those series are covered by the same QUnit patterns
#   without a runtime witness. 8.0-10.0 index no JS suite at all; there the
#   fields are legitimately EMPTY, never 0.
#
#   LEVEL SENSITIVITY: the failing halves (`[HOOT] Test ... failed:`,
#   `QUnit test failed:`, the QUnit aggregate) are logged at ERROR, so they
#   survive any level this script emits. The Hoot suite trailers and both green
#   markers are INFO. A caller who forces a level above INFO through --extra
#   therefore loses the root-suite sum (the count falls back to the per-test
#   line count, which is <= it) and loses green-run detection - never a false
#   green, but a possible undercount. The shared default is `info` and `warn` is
#   refused outright, so the default path is unaffected.

# Test-outcome marker SSOT (read from Odoo source, all 12 series v8.0-v19.0).
#   Split by WHAT EACH MARKER PROVES, not merely by wording, because the two
#   verdict paths need different questions answered from the same set:
#   _parse_test_result asks "did this FINISHED run fail?" (any of them), while
#   _scan_build_markers asks "is this RUNNING build's outcome decided yet?"
#   (none of them - only the run's own verdict line or a _BUILD_ABORT_RE hit).
#
#   _TEST_FAIL_PER_TEST_*_RE - ONE failing test. `FAIL:`/`ERROR:` message
#     bodies (distinct from the ERROR log LEVEL) exist on every series. MID-RUN
#     by construction: the suite carries on to the next test afterwards.
#   _TEST_FAIL_MODULE_RE - the per-MODULE aggregate, byte-identical across the
#     eras apart from a suffix ("Module <m>: <F> failures, <E> errors" v8.0-v13.0
#     modules/module.py; the same plus " of <T> tests" v14.0-v19.0
#     modules/loading.py). Also MID-RUN: it is logged inside the module loop, so
#     the run still has later modules to load. Odoo emits it ONLY for a module
#     whose suite was not successful, so it can never carry "0 failures, 0
#     errors" - no non-zero guard needed, and it never contributes a false zero
#     to a count.
#   _TEST_FAIL_BLANKET_RE - loading.py's numberless line, on all 12 series. It
#     states THAT something failed and never how much.
#   _TEST_SUMMARY_RE - v14.0-v19.0's per-database total: tests/result.py's
#     OdooTestResult.__str__ rendered by service/server.py's "%s when loading
#     database %r". The run-level figure, so it WINS over the per-module lines
#     when a count is being read (a v14+ run logs both wordings; summing across
#     them would double-count).
#   _TEST_FAIL_PY_RE - the PYTHON half of "this finished run failed". Named
#     separately because the findings file quotes it as the aggregate/abort
#     evidence a run left when it named no individual Python test; quoting the
#     JS half there would duplicate the per-run JS section.
#   _TEST_FAIL_RE - the union: "this finished run failed". _parse_test_result's
#     verdict input, and the gate _scan_build_markers puts in front of a
#     completion marker so a summary reporting its own non-zero counts can never
#     be certified as a successful build. It unions the Python wordings above
#     with _JS_FAIL_RE (SSOT block immediately above): the per-test vocabulary
#     of a --test-enable build is TWO vocabularies, and neither is a subset of
#     the other.
#   _TEST_RAN_*_RE - the POSITIVE "tests actually RAN" marker, and the ONLY
#     era-SPLIT one: v8.0-v13.0 emit `Ran <N> test(s) in <X>s` (stdlib runner
#     trailer, INFO), v14.0-v19.0 emit the _TEST_SUMMARY_RE wording. Both
#     REQUIRE a non-zero total, so a tag filter that matched nothing can never
#     certify a pass.
#   _TEST_SKIP_RE - a test the runner SKIPPED. Not a failure (a @tagged filter
#     or a missing optional external dependency produces one legitimately) and
#     not a pass either, so it is the one marker that turns an otherwise-clean
#     ran-marker into `inconclusive`. BOTH verdict paths read it: it is why
#     _parse_test_result refuses `passed`, and why _scan_build_markers refuses
#     to certify SUCCESS from a bare ran-marker. Held here rather than inside
#     one function because a skip-aware verdict path and a skip-blind one
#     answering opposite things about one log is precisely the disagreement
#     this SSOT block exists to prevent.
#     BOTH alternatives anchor on a real test-package PATH SEGMENT, never a
#     bare substring: a literal `.` immediately before the "test(s)" token (so
#     it is a whole dot-delimited segment) and a literal `.`/`:` immediately
#     after it (so a longer word cannot satisfy it). Without those anchors it
#     false-positives on ordinary model/module names that merely CONTAIN
#     "test" and on unrelated `... skipped` business messages.
#       1. v14+ modern Odoo test-runner logger name: `(openerp|odoo).<pkg
#          path>.tests?[.:]<...>: skip[ped] <name>` (<ns> = openerp v8-v9 /
#          odoo v10+, matching _resolve_log_ns).
#       2. Older Python-stdlib unittest verbose runner line (bypasses the Odoo
#          logger, so no <ns> prefix): `test_name (<module path containing a
#          .tests. or .test. segment>) ... skipped`.
#     The exact per-series wording is Odoo framework-internal, so this is
#     deliberately a two-shape, case-insensitive regex - but never a bare
#     `grep -i skip`, which reopens both false-positive classes above.

#   demote it to failure, in any branch. A marker that decides an outcome is a
#   terminal marker and belongs in one of the sets above.
#
#   Why a separate set at all: the only in-flight evidence this scan used to
#   report was `loading <N> modules...`, which Odoo logs ONCE per registry load.
#   During a test suite it therefore never changes, so "the same evidence twice
#   means the build stopped" was false for every long test run - a healthy suite
#   and an odoo-bin that had been killed mid-suite produced byte-identical
#   output. The markers below advance while the suite runs, which is what makes
#   that rule true.
#
#   MEASURED by reading the Odoo source of all 12 supported series (8.0-19.0)
#   for the literal format string AND the level it is logged at - the level
#   matters because the shared default is `info`, so a DEBUG line is invisible.
#   Applied era-BLIND on purpose: a rendered log only ever holds its OWN
#   series' wording, and every wording below means the SAME thing ("one more
#   unit of work finished"), so a cross-era match cannot mislead. That is the
#   opposite of _test_ran_re, which MUST gate by series because there the two
#   wordings certify a pass and accepting the wrong era's would be a false
#   green.
#
#   _PROGRESS_DATAFILE_RE - modules/loading.py logs `loading <module>/<file>`
#     at INFO once per data file it converts. Present on ALL 12 series and the
#     only progress wording that is; covers the module-install phase of every
#     verb, including the install phase of a --test-enable build.
#   _PROGRESS_TEST_START_RE - the test result class logs `Starting
#     <Class>.<method> ...` at INFO once per test STARTED, from 13.0 onward
#     (modules/module.py at 13.0, tests/runner.py at 14.0-15.0, tests/result.py
#     from 16.0). Per-test granularity, so it advances throughout a long suite.
#   _PROGRESS_TEST_MODULE_RE - 8.0-13.0 modules/module.py logs `<test module>
#     running tests.` at INFO once per test MODULE entered. This is the only
#     test-phase progress wording 8.0-12.0 emit at all, so on those five series
#     progress advances per test FILE rather than per test - coarser, still
#     advancing, and it is why a stall reading is weaker (not absent) there.
#
#   Deliberately NOT used, each for a measured reason:
#     `Loading module <name> (<i>/<n>)` - DEBUG on 10.0-13.0 and absent before
#       10.0, so invisible at the `info` floor across half the range.
#     `Modules loaded.` - loading.py logs it XOR `At least one test failed when
#       loading the modules.` on all 12 series, so a --test-enable build with
#       any at_install failure never emits it. It is a terminal marker for
#       init/update regardless and must not be counted as progress.

# _build_progress <logf> - one comparable reading of HOW FAR the build has got.
#   Two consecutive readings that DIFFER prove the build did work in between;
#   two that are IDENTICAL and non-empty prove it wrote NOTHING AT ALL in
#   between. It answers nothing about pass/fail and no caller may derive an
#   outcome from it.
#
#   BOTH components are emitted ALWAYS, as `markers:<n>|bytes:<m>` - never one
#   OR the other. An either/or reading is what froze this field on real runs:
#   every build publishes hundreds of install-phase progress lines, so `markers`
#   is permanently non-zero long before the test phase starts, which permanently
#   suppressed a byte fallback that only ever fired at `markers:0`. The byte
#   count was therefore unavailable in the ONE state where it is the only signal
#   left - a test phase spent inside a single long test.
#
#   `markers:<n>` - n progress lines the run published (SSOT:
#     _BUILD_PROGRESS_RE). The STRONG component: n rises only when the build
#     actually finished another data file, test module, or test, so a rise is
#     proof of a completed unit of work. It CAN sit still through a healthy run:
#     a browser/JS suite is one test that streams thousands of console lines
#     under a logger no progress wording matches, and on the earliest series the
#     finest granularity is one test FILE.
#   `bytes:<m>` - the log's own length. The WEAK component, and weak in one
#     direction only: a rise proves only that something was appended, not that
#     the build advanced - but it is what makes the reading MOVE for any run
#     that is still writing, including one inside a single long test and one at
#     a caller-chosen level that suppresses every progress wording. Both
#     components carry their own prefix so a reader can always tell which fact
#     moved.
#   Composed, the reading is FROZEN only when the process appended zero bytes
#   for the whole comparison window - which is the strongest in-log evidence of
#   a stopped build available without signalling the process, and is still not
#   proof of death (a hung browser suite writes nothing either, until its own
#   timeout fires). The caller's stall rule must stay worded accordingly.
#   EMPTY - there is no log file to measure. Absence of a reading is NOT a
#     stall; it is the absence of evidence either way, and the caller must not
#     resolve it as success, failure, or a stopped build.

# _js_fail_counts <logf> - the JS (Hoot/QUnit) half of the per-test vocabulary,
#   read PER LOGGER SCOPE. Prints a TAB-separated report, or NOTHING when the
#   log carries no JS marker at all (unmeasured - the caller emits EMPTY, never
#   0, exactly as it does for the Python counts):
#
#     SUMMARY <mode> <runs> <reported> <tests>
#     RUN     <scope> <framework> <reported> <tests>
#     TEST    <scope> <failing test name>
#
#   TWO count fields, because the two frameworks count DIFFERENT UNITS and
#   neither derives from the other:
#     <reported> = each run's OWN published figure summed over runs. QUnit's
#       aggregate counts failed ASSERTIONS; Hoot's root trailers count failed
#       TESTS. Mixed units on purpose - it is what the runs themselves said.
#     <tests>    = distinct failing TEST NAMES, always the same unit, and the
#       key the findings file is written on. EMPTY in `unscoped` mode, where no
#       per-test name is recoverable.
#   Reporting only one of them would either discard the run's own figure or
#   claim a test count the run never published; on the real corpus the two
#   differ by up to 2.18x within a single scope.
#
#   Per scope:
#     hoot  = max(per-test failure lines, sum of ROOT suite trailers). The two
#             disagree by ~1 percent on real logs; the max is the safe floor and
#             the root sum is what recovers failures that ended without their
#             own per-test line.
#     qunit = sum over the DISTINCT (failed,total) aggregate pairs. Odoo prints
#             each aggregate twice inside its scope (once at ERROR, once at INFO
#             prefixed "Error received after termination"), so the pair set - not
#             the line count - is the figure.
#
#   UNSCOPED FALLBACK: when the log carries NO scope line at all but does carry
#   a bare `<F> / <T> tests failed` aggregate, that figure is taken and the mode
#   is reported as `unscoped` so the caller knows per-test names are
#   unavailable. Two real 17.0 logs publish their only aggregate that way; the
#   scope anchor alone silently loses both. This cannot pick up the traceback
#   echo: the echo is a `success_signal="..."` source line, never an aggregate.
#   When any scope line exists the unscoped bucket is IGNORED - it holds
#   duplicate copies of the scoped figures.

#   diffs across two polls to learn whether the build is still doing work; see
#   _build_progress) and BUILD_MARKER=<matched line>, then returns:
#     0 -> DECIDED as a PASS. init/update: the "Modules loaded."
#          completion marker present AND no _INSTALL_FAIL_RE hit - by
#          construction the verdict _install_confirmed reaches on this same log,
#          so BUILD_RESULT can never disagree with the script's own
#          STATUS=ok|error line. test: the run's own TEST_RESULT= line says
#          passed, or (before that line lands) the era-correct ran-marker is
#          present with NO failure marker and NO skip marker anywhere - which is
#          exactly the state _parse_test_result calls `passed`.
#     1 -> DECIDED as a failure. init/update: any _INSTALL_FAIL_RE hit (a
#          silent-skip marker such as "invalid module names, ignored" alongside
#          "Modules loaded." is STILL a failed build, exactly as
#          _install_confirmed rules it). test: the run's own
#          TEST_RESULT=failed, or a _BUILD_ABORT_RE hit proving odoo-bin died
#          and will therefore never publish a verdict to wait for. ALSO the
#          fail-safe arm for a TEST_RESULT= value this scan does not recognize:
#          a scanner that has fallen behind the emitter may not certify a build
#          green, and a loud wrong RED is recoverable where a silent GREEN is
#          not.
#     2 -> NOT DECIDED yet (build still in flight; the last progress line is
#          echoed as evidence).
#     3 -> DECIDED, and NOT a pass: the run's own TEST_RESULT=inconclusive. The
#          run FINISHED - it is terminal, so a caller must not wait again - but
#          it proved no pass: the suite ran nothing, or everything it matched
#          was skipped. Distinct from 2 for that reason: reporting it as "not
#          finished" would leave a poller waiting forever on a run that is over,
#          and reporting it as 0 hands the caller a pass the run explicitly
#          refused to claim.
#   The verb comes from the log's OWN stamp. UNSTAMPED = UNKNOWN, and UNKNOWN
#   takes the `test` predicate: it is the narrower rule in both directions, so it
#   is the only one that cannot certify a wrong answer on a log whose shape it
#   does not know. See the branch itself for the per-marker reasoning.
#
#   What is deliberately NOT terminal for a `test` run, and why: a per-test
#   FAIL:/ERROR: marker, its traceback, and the per-MODULE failure aggregate.
#   All three are MID-RUN - the suite carries on to the next test and the next
#   module - and cmd_test appends the authoritative TEST_RESULT= line when the
#   run actually finishes. Returning failure at the first of them stops the wait
#   while odoo-bin is still working and hands the caller a verdict the run never
#   published; a caller that learns the wait does that goes back to hand-rolling
#   a poll loop, which is the behavior this mechanism exists to remove. They
#   still keep a completion marker from certifying SUCCESS (the _TEST_FAIL_RE
#   gate below), so the un-decided answer is the only thing they can produce.
#
#   "Initiating shutdown"/a bare process exit 0 remain named as progress/
#   heartbeat signals in agents/odoo-instance-ops.md's "Active-wait on long
#   builds" section, but are NOT independently sufficient for
#   BUILD_RESULT=success here. Markers are version-stable v8.0-v19.0 except
#   where the SSOT blocks above record an era split; the caller's own process
#   exit code stays authoritative - this is the in-log completion signal.

    #
    # UNKNOWN verb (no stamp - a log written before the stamp existed, or one

    # default-to-the-first-branch:
    #   * The install predicate certifies SUCCESS from "Modules loaded.". On a
    #     --test-enable log that line lands BEFORE the post-install suite starts,
    #     so applying it to an unknown log certifies a build whose tests have not
    #     run - a false GREEN, the one error class that must never be reachable.
    #   * The install predicate also rules FAILURE on a lone traceback, which on
    #     a test log is per-test/incidental evidence (SSOT above) - a false RED
    #     on a healthy run.
    #   * The test predicate can produce NEITHER error on an install log: such a
    #     log publishes no TEST_RESULT= line and no ran-marker, so it can never
    #     be certified success, and _BUILD_ABORT_RE stays terminal for every
    #     verb, so a genuine abort is still ruled failure. What it gives up is
    #     ruling a traceback-only install failure terminal; that degrades to "not
    #     decided", which the caller resolves as BLOCKED with the log preserved.
    #     Refusing to certify is the safe direction; a confident wrong verdict is
    #     not.
    # Inferring the verb from the log's own content was rejected: a test log
    # truncated after "Modules loaded." but before its first test line carries no
